### Investigating with Data
1. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System):
   SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) is a centralized security platform that collects, analyzes, and correlates logs and event data from multiple sources such as servers, network devices, applications, and security tools. It helps security teams detect threats, investigate incidents, and respond to security events in real time by providing alerts, dashboards, and compliance reports.
   
2. Log file:
   Log files are records automatically generated by operating systems, applications, and network devices that document system activities, user actions, errors, and security events. These files are essential for troubleshooting, monitoring system health, and investigating security incidents.
   
3. Syslog/Rsyslog/Syslog-ng:
   Syslog, Rsyslog, and Syslog-ng are logging standards and services used mainly on Unix and Linux systems to collect, store, and forward log messages. They enable centralized logging by sending system and application logs from multiple devices to a central log server for analysis and long-term storage.
   
4. Journalctl:
   Journalctl is a command-line utility used to view and manage logs stored by the systemd journal on Linux systems. It allows administrators to search, filter, and analyze system logs based on time, service, priority level, or specific events.
   
5. NXlog:
   NXLog is a cross-platform log collection and forwarding tool that works on both Windows and Linux systems. It is commonly used to gather logs from endpoints and transmit them securely to SIEM platforms or centralized log servers for further analysis.
   
6. NetFlow:
   NetFlow is a network protocol developed by Cisco that collects information about IP traffic flows passing through network devices such as routers and switches. It provides visibility into network usage patterns, traffic sources, destinations, and potential security threats.
   
7. Sampled Flow (SFlow):
   Sampled Flow (sFlow) is a traffic monitoring technology that captures and analyzes sampled packets and interface counters from network devices. Instead of recording every packet, it samples data at intervals, making it more efficient for high-speed networks (open-source tool).
   
8. Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX):
   Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) is an industry-standard protocol for exporting network flow information from devices to monitoring systems. It is based on NetFlow and allows flexible data formats, making it suitable for advanced traffic analysis and security monitoring.
   
9. Metadata:
   Metadata refers to data that describes other data, such as timestamps, IP addresses, file sizes, user IDs, and access times. In cybersecurity, metadata is used to analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and support investigations without necessarily accessing the actual content of communications.

```
Now, all three of these tools, NetFlow, SFlow, and IPFIX can give you a good idea of how much bandwidth is being used in your environment.
