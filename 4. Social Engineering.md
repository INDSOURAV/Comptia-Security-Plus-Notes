-  Manipulative strategy that exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access to system, data, or physical spaces.
- Social Engineering, manipulate people to reveal confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
### Motivational Triggers
The backbone of social engineering lies in the ability of an attacker to trick a user into doing something for them.
There are 6 main type of motivation triggers that social engineers use:
1. Authority
2. Urgency
3. Social Proof
4. Scarcity
5. Likability
6. Fear

Explanations:
1. Authority:
   People are more likely to comply with requests when they come from someone perceived as an authority.
   Example: An email pretending to be from your company’s IT department asks you to reset your password to "prevent a security breach." Since it’s coming from "IT," you feel pressured to act quickly.
2. Urgency: 
   Creating a sense of urgency pressures people into making quick decisions, often leading them to act without thinking.
   Example: A scammer calls you, saying, “You need to confirm your bank details immediately or your account will be locked forever!” The urgency makes you panic and give out your information.
3. Social Proof: 
   People tend to follow the actions of others, especially in unfamiliar situations. The more others seem to be doing something, the more likely a person is to do it too.
   Example: A phishing email shows fake testimonials or claims that “thousands of people have already claimed their free prize,” making you think it’s legitimate.
4. Scarcity: 
   When something is perceived as scarce or in limited supply, people often desire it more, leading them to act quickly to avoid missing out.
   Example: “Only 3 spots left for this exclusive offer! Act now before it's too late!” This makes you feel pressured to take action immediately.
5. Likability: 
   People are more likely to comply with requests from individuals they like or trust.
   Example: A scammer may pose as someone you know or trust, like a friend or colleague, asking you to share your personal info in a casual conversation. Because they’re "likable," you may not question their request.
6. Fear: 
   This involves creating fear or anxiety, motivating people to act to avoid a perceived threat.
   Example: A phone call claims that your bank account has been compromised, and if you don’t act fast, all your money will be stolen. Fear pushes you to follow the instructions without questioning their legitimacy.
### Impersonation
When it comes to impersonation as a social engineering technique, there are four main forms of impersonation used by attackers:
1. Impersonation
2. Brand Impersonation
3. Typo squatting
4. Watering Hole Attacks

Explanations:
1. Impersonation:
   This is when an attacker pretends to be someone you know or trust in order to manipulate you into disclosing sensitive information or performing certain actions.
   Example: A hacker might call you, pretending to be from your bank’s customer service team, asking you to verify your account details to "resolve a security issue." Because they sound official, you might be tricked into providing personal information.
2. Brand Impersonation: 
   In this case, an attacker impersonates a well-known company or brand, using their name, logo, and official-looking communication to gain your trust and steal information.
   Example: You receive an email that looks like it’s from PayPal, asking you to update your account details for "security reasons." The email includes the PayPal logo and website link, making it seem legitimate, but it’s a fake email designed to steal your login credentials.
3. Typo Squatting: 
   This involves creating fake websites or domains that closely resemble a legitimate website but with minor typographical errors, such as a misspelled domain name, hoping you’ll accidentally visit the wrong site.
   Example: You accidentally type "gogogle.com" instead of "google.com," and the fake site looks just like Google’s homepage. It could then prompt you to enter your login credentials, stealing them in the process.
4. Watering Hole Attacks: 
   Attackers target websites or online platforms that are likely to be visited by the victims they want to attack, and inject malicious code into these sites. When a user visits the compromised site, they unknowingly download malware or get phished.
   Example: If a company’s employees regularly visit a specific industry news site, attackers might inject malware into that site. When employees visit the site, the malware can infect their devices or steal sensitive information without them knowing.
### Pretexting
Pretexting is a social engineering technique where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario or "pretext" to manipulate a target into revealing sensitive information or performing actions they wouldn't normally do. The attacker often invents a story or excuse that sounds legitimate to the victim, helping them gain access to personal data, accounts, or systems.

How it works:
The attacker typically creates a false identity or situation and convinces the target to believe it is real. They may use different personas depending on the target (e.g., pretending to be a co-worker, a customer service representative, or a government official). The goal is to get the victim to give out confidential information such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or financial details.

Example:
Scenario: An attacker calls a bank, pretending to be an employee from the bank’s fraud department. They tell the bank's customer that there’s been suspicious activity on their account and ask for their account number and personal information to “verify” their identity.
What happens: The customer, trusting the person on the other end of the phone and believing the "urgent" situation, ends up revealing their information to the attacker.
### Phishing Attack
There are different types of Phishing attack:
1. Phishing
2. Spear Phishing
3. Whaling
4. Business Email Compromise
5. Vishing 
6. Smishing

Explanation:
1. Phishing:
   An attacker uses fraudulent emails, websites, or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick victims into revealing sensitive information, like login credentials or financial details. It usually involves sending out bulk emails to many people, hoping to trick some into clicking malicious links or downloading attachments.
   Example: You receive an email that looks like it's from your bank, claiming your account has been compromised and asking you to click a link to verify your information. The link takes you to a fake website designed to steal your credentials.
   
2. Spear Phishing
   Spear phishing is a more targeted form of phishing. Attackers tailor their messages to a specific individual or organization, often using personal information to make the email appear more credible and trustworthy. Unlike regular phishing, which casts a wide net, spear phishing is focused and highly personalized.
   Example: An attacker sends an email pretending to be a coworker, referencing a recent project you worked on together, and asks you to open an attachment that contains malware. Because it’s personalized, you’re more likely to trust it.
   
    **Phishing → "Spray and Pray"**
    **Spear Phishing → "Target Users"**
   
3. Whaling: 
   Whaling is a type of phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals, such as CEOs, executives, or important decision-makers within an organization. These attacks often focus on creating highly customized, high-stakes scenarios that make the victim believe they are in a critical situation.
   Example: A CEO receives an email that looks like it's from the company’s legal team, urgently requesting funds to resolve a legal issue. The email is well-crafted, and the CEO, feeling pressure, may authorize a large payment without questioning the source.

4. Business Email Compromise (BEC):
   BEC attacks involve cybercriminals compromising or impersonating a legitimate business email account to trick employees into transferring money, sharing confidential data, or performing actions that benefit the attacker. BEC is highly targeted and can be very costly for businesses.
   Example: An attacker hacks into the email account of a company’s CFO and sends an email to the accounts department requesting a wire transfer to a foreign bank account. The email looks legitimate, so the transfer is made without suspicion.

5. Vishing (Voice Phishing):
   Vishing involves phishing attacks carried out over the phone. The attacker typically impersonates someone from a trusted organization (e.g., a bank, government agency, or tech support) and convinces the victim to disclose sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or account passwords.
   Example: A caller claims to be from your bank’s fraud department, stating they’ve noticed suspicious activity on your account. They ask you to confirm your account details and PIN over the phone.
   
6. 6. Smishing (SMS Phishing):
   Smishing is a type of phishing attack that uses SMS (text messages) instead of email. The attacker sends a text message that appears to be from a legitimate source, often with a link to a fake website or instructions to call a fraudulent number.
   Example: You receive a text message saying, “Your package has been delayed. Click here to confirm your delivery information.” The link takes you to a fake site designed to steal your personal or financial information.
# Preventing Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks are a common and dangerous threat, and it's essential to know how to recognize and avoid them:
1. Urgency:
   Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency to get you to act without thinking. They may threaten to suspend your account or ask you to respond immediately to avoid consequences.
   
2. Unusual Requests:
   Phishing attacks often involve unusual requests for personal information that a legitimate company would never ask for via email, such as passwords or Social Security numbers.

3. Misleading URLs:
   A common phishing tactic is using URLs that look like legitimate ones but have slight changes, such as extra characters or misspellings, making them appear official when they’re not or malicious URLs can also be hidden behind HTML text or images, so the link you click on may not be the one you see.

4. Strange Email Addresses:
   Phishing emails often come from suspicious or misspelled email addresses to look like they’re from a trusted company. The fake email address might contain small spelling errors.

5. Poor Spelling and Grammar:
   Phishing emails often contain spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or unusual language. These errors can be a clear indicator that the email is fake.

Anti-phishing Campaign:
Vital too for educating individuals about phishing risks and how to recognize potential phishing attempts in user security awareness training.
### Frauds and Scams
##### Fraud
- The wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.
- The difference between fraud and theft is that in fraud, the attacker deceives you into revealing personal information or sensitive data, whereas in theft, the attacker takes something directly without your knowledge or consent.

Most common type of fraud that you will see online - Identity fraud/ Identity theft:
- The use by one person or another person's personal information, without authorization, to commit a crime or to deceive or defraud that other person or a third person.
- Terms identity fraud and identity theft used interchangeably even though there is a slight difference between them:
	- Identity Fraud: Attacker takes the victim's credit card number and makes charges
	- Identity Theft: Attacker tries o fully assume the identity of their victim
##### Scam
A fraudulent or deceptive act or operation.
Example:
Invoice scam: a scam in which a person is tricked into paying for a fake invoice for a service or product that they did not order.

```
identity fraud and invoice scam are low-tech social engineering techniques
```
### Influence Campaigns
- Influence campaign are a powerful tool for shaping public opinion and behavior.
- In cybersecurity, the main focus is malicious influence campaign by high-level threat actors such as nation-state and hacktivists, this can lead "Misinformation" and "Disinformation".

```
Misinformation: inaccurate information shared unintentionally
Disinformation: intentional spread of false information to deceive or mislead
```
### Other Social Engineering Attacks
1. Diversion Theft:
   Diversion theft involves tricking a person into diverting their attention while a thief takes an item. It’s often used in retail or workplaces.
   Example: A hacker infects a victim's computer with malware that changes their DNS settings. When the victim tries to log into their online banking account, they are redirected to a fake website that looks identical, where their login details are stolen.

2. Hoaxes:
   A hoax is a deliberate attempt to deceive someone by providing false information, often for malicious or financial gain.
   Example: A hacker sends an email pretending to be from a bank, warning the recipient that their account is compromised and asking for personal details like passwords or credit card numbers.
   
3. Shoulder Surfing:
   Shoulder surfing is when someone watches over your shoulder to gain access to private information. This typically happens in public places.
   Example: A person standing behind you in a coffee shop might look at your phone while you're entering a password, later using it for fraudulent activities.

4. Dumpster Diving:
   Dumpster diving is the act of searching through trash to find discarded items that could contain personal or sensitive information.
   Example: Someone goes through your old papers in the trash to find bank statements, which they can use to steal your identity.

5. Eavesdropping:
   Eavesdropping is secretly listening to someone’s conversation without their consent, usually to gather private information.
   Example: A hacker listens in on an unprotected Wi-Fi network to capture sensitive data like passwords or credit card details being transmitted.

6. Baiting:
   Baiting involves offering something enticing to lure people into giving up their personal information or downloading malicious software.
   Example: A fake advertisement online offers a free movie download, but when clicked, it installs malware on the victim’s device.

7. Piggybacking or Tailgating:
   Piggybacking is when someone gains unauthorized access to a restricted area by following an authorized person in.
   Example: A person without a security card waits for someone to enter a building and then follows them in without being noticed, gaining access to the premises.
