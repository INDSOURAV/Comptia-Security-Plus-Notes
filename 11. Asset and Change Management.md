##### Asset Management
Systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, and selling assets in a cost-effective manner.
##### Change Management
Structured approach to transitioning individual, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state.

```
In cybersecurity, asset management and change management are two of the critical pillars that are used to safeguard an organization's data and infrastructure. Asset management is going to ensure that all of the digital assets, ranging from hardware devices to software applications, have been identified, cataloged, and monitored, and therefore this helps us to reduce potential vulnerability and ensure that the security protocols are consistently being applied across all our assets. Meanwhile, change management is used to guarantee that any modifications to our system, whether they are to software updates or new technology implementations, are being done in a controlled and secure manner, and this prevents unforeseen security gaps or misconfiguration from occurring. Together, these practices provide us with a structured framework to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.

### Acquisition and Procurement
##### Acquisition
Process of obtaining goods and services
##### Procurement
Encompasses the full process of acquiring goods and services, including all preceding steps.
##### Different types of purchase options:
1. Company Credit Card:
   Organizations often permit employees to use company credit cards for small purchases on the organization's behalf.
2. Individual Purchase:
   An individual purchase entails employees buying on the company's behalf and later seeking reimbursement from the employer.
3. Use of Purchase Orders:
   An approval process for purchases ensures alignment with the company's goals and needs.
   It's a formal document issued by a buyer to a seller, detailing the specific goods or services being ordered, their quantities, and agreed prices.
   
Acquisition and Procurement involve more than just buying something. Acquisition and Procurement are structured processes that are designed to ensure the financial prudence, operational efficiency, and increased level of security for your organization enterprise network.
### Mobile Asset Deployment
There are three main mobile device deployment models that organizations tend to utilize:
1. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
2. Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)
3. Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)

Explanations:
1. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):
   Permits employees to use personal devices for work, in BYOD employees own and control the security of their devices.
    - Personal devices must undergo security checks and have specific software for protecting company data.
    - Organization might not have the ability to manage or update the device for users, or enforce stricter security configuration.
      
2. Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE):
   Involves the company providing a mobile device to employees for both and personal user, this standardizes device management but may be expensive for employers providing devices to staff.
   
3. Choose Your Own Device (CYOD):
   Offers a middle ground between BYOD and COPE by allowing employees to choose devices from a company-approved list, provide for company work only.

While making decision, organization consider these main areas:
- Costs
- Security
- Employee Satisfaction

⇾ BYOD is cost-effective, but hidden costs may arise related to security and compatibility.
⇾ BYOD and CYOD models are suitable for prioritizing employees' freedom and choice.
⇾ COPE and CYOD have higher upfront costs but save on ongoing support due to fewer supported device models
⇾ CYOD provides optimal control over devices and enables management through the organization's MDM solution.
### Asset Management
Refers to the systematic approach to governing and maximizing the value of items an entity is responsible for throughout their lifecycle.

Asset management is really focused on two main areas:
1. Assignment/Accounting
2. Monitoring/Asset Tracking

Explanations:
1. Assignment/Accounting:
   Every organization should designate individuals or groups as owners for each of its assets.
   Now, in addition to assigning the owner of each asset, each asset should also be classified and categorized based on function, value or other relevant parameters determined by the organizations.

2. Monitoring/Tracking:
   Ensures proper accountability and optimal use of each asset.
   Asset Tracking: Involves maintaining a comprehensive inventory with asset specifications, locations, assigned users and relevant details.
   
   This asset monitoring will allow your asset manager, to maintain a well-maintained inventory that can help us understand which employee is using which laptop, its specific MAC and model and when it was last serviced. Now asset tracking, on other hand, is going to take asset monitoring a bit further by monitoring and managing location, status and condition of physical assets by using specialized software tracking technology.
##### Enumeration:
Involves identifying and counting assets, especially in large organizations or during times of asset procurement or retirement.
By regular enumeration, organization can ensure:
 - Maintains accurate inventory
 - Detects unauthorized devices
 - Informs software update decisions
 - Addresses security vulnerabilities
### Mobile Device Management (MDM)
Lets organizations securely oversee employee devices, ensuring policy enforcement, software consistency, and data protection.

MDM's centralization boots security by ensuring all devices comply with the latest standards and protocols and lowers risks tied to unsecured or outdated devices.
Asset management guarantees the organization's assets are optimally utilized, delivering maximum value and security.
### Asset Disposal and Decommissioning
The special publication 800-80 by NIST, commonly referred to as the "Guidelines for Media Sanitization".
These guidelines provide our organizations with guidance on how to conduct Sanitization, Destruction and Certificate for our asset disposal and decommissioning processes.
##### Sanitization
The thorough process of making data inaccessible and irretrievable from a storage medium using traditional forensic methods such as:
- Overwriting Data:
  Replacing the existing data on a storage device with random bits of information to ensure that the original data to obscured, each overwrite makes it increasingly difficult for potential adversaries to retrieve any meaningful data using forensic tools.
- Degaussing:
  Involves using a machine called a degausser to produce a strong magnetic field that can disrupt the magnetic domains on storage devices like hard drives or tapes, after degaussing, a device loses its data storage capability.
- Secure Erase:
  Completely deletes data from a storage device while ensuring that it can't be recovered using traditional recovery tools.
  When the Secure Erase command is issued, the storage device's built-in erasure routine is going to be activated, and it's going to purge all the data blocks to make the data irretrievable from that device.
  
  Cryptographic Erase was introduced to replace the Secure Erase technique in most modern storage devices, the one significant advantage of cryptographic erase over traditional erasure methods is speed.
##### Destruction
Ensure the physical device itself is beyond recovery or reuse.
- Shredding: Physically cutting the media into small pieces.
- Pulverizing: Crushing the media into fine particles.
- Melting: Using high heat to destroy the physical structure of the media.
- Incinerating: Burning the media to completely eliminate data-bearing components.
##### Certification
An act of proof that the data or hardware has been securely disposed of, organizations should prioritize data security by documenting the sanitization, disposal, or destruction of data.

```
Data retention focuses on strategically deciding what data to keep and for how long. Regulations may require certain types of data—such as financial transactions or medical records—to be retained for a specific period. However, the more data an organization stores, the greater the security responsibility and risk, as all retained data must be properly protected from unauthorized access, loss, or breaches.

```
### Change Management
An organization's orchestrated strategy to transition from its existing state (teams, department and entire organization) to a more desirable future state.

Disruptions can occur when changes are introduced into existing processes, potentially affecting their efficiency and effectiveness. Change management ensures that such changes are planned, evaluated, and integrated smoothly into the existing architecture and processes, minimizing disruption while maintaining operational stability and performance.

##### Approval
- Change Advisory Board (CAB):
  Body of representatives from various parts of an organization that is responsible for evaluation of any proposed changes.
- Change Owner:
  An individual or a team that initiates the change request.
- Stakeholder:
  A person who has a vested interest in the proposed change.
  These individual or teams must be consulted, and their feedback considered as well as their concerns getting addressed before you implement a change, stakeholder such as "Technical Stakeholder", "Business Stakeholders" and "End user-based Stakeholder".
  
  For example, consider an update to an online examination platform. There are technical stakeholders, such as developers and system administrators, who are responsible for updating the servers, testing the changes, and ensuring the application runs smoothly. There are also business stakeholders, such as the student support team, who need to understand how the change may affect users so they can handle queries or issues. Finally, there are end-user stakeholders, such as students, who will use the system and must be informed about the update so they can prepare in advance. All these stakeholders must be consulted or informed before the change is implemented to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption.
##### Impact Analysis
An integral part of change management process that involves understanding of change's potential fallout.
- What could go wrong?
- What would be the immediate effects?
- How would the long-term operations be impacted?
- Are there unforeseen challenges that might cause an issue?

Change management is a critical process that guides organizations safely through any changes or transformations needed.
### Change Management Process
1. Preparations
2. Vision for changes
3. Implementation
4. Verification
5. Documentation

Explanations:
1. Preparations:
   Involves assessing the current state and recognizing the need for transition.
   At this stage, it's crucial to gather all the necessary resources, engage stakeholders, and ensure that the organization is both mentally and operationally ready for the change ahead.

2. Vision for changes:
   A clear, compelling description of the desired future state that is guiding the transformation process within an organization, such as "Define future state", "Explain reasons for changes" and "Ensure vivid vision".

3. Implementation:
   Putting the plan into action.
    - Training
    - Restructuring teams
    - Introducing new technologies
    - Continuous communication

4. Verification:
   Measuring the change's effectiveness by comparing it to the initial objectives.
    - Surveys
    - Performance metrics analysis
    - Stakeholder interviews

5. Documentation:
   Creating a thorough record of the entire change process. 
    - Reflect on past initiatives
    - Understand decision
    - Improve practice

There are areas to be considered throughout the change management process:
1. user of scheduled maintenance windows, but a scheduled maintenance window does not restrict changes implementation as emergencies may require action.
2. Creation of a back out plan, a predetermined strategy for restoring systems to their initial state in case a change does not go as expected.
3. Testing of results
4. Use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a step-by-step instruction that guides the carrying out of a specific task to maintain consistency and efficiency.
### Technical Implications of Changes
1. Allow and Deny lists
2. Restricted Activities
3. Complex Applications Interplay
4. Dependencies

Explanations:
1. Allow and Deny lists:
   Allow and deny lists should be placed to ensure proper system function and uncompromised security, such as firewall or routers allow and deny lists.

2. Restricted Activities:
   During the technical implementation of changes, certain activities must be restricted or controlled to prevent data breaches, service outages, and operational disruptions. Unplanned actions such as unauthorized configuration changes, service or application restarts, or system shutdowns can lead to data loss in transit, incomplete transactions, and processing backlogs during downtime. Clearly defining and enforcing restricted activities helps maintain system stability, data integrity, and service availability throughout the change process.

3. Complex Applications Interplay:
   Legacy Application:
   Older software or system that is still being used and meets the needs of users, legacy applications can malfunction or crash from even minor updates in other parts of the system.

4. Dependencies:
   Before implementing any proposed changes, it is crucial to identify and map existing system dependencies to prevent minor changes from causing unintended impacts. Understanding dependencies between applications, services, databases, and network components helps ensure that updates do not disrupt related systems or break existing functionality.
### Documenting Changes:
Documenting changes provides a clear history of the what, when and why for accountability and future reference.
- Version Control:
  Tracks and manages changes in documents and software, enabling collaborative work and reverting to prior versions when needed.
- Proper Documentation:
  ⇾ Properly document and record every change
  ⇾ Update diagram
  ⇾ Revise policies and procedures
  ⇾ Update change requests
  ⇾ Maintain associated trouble tickets

Updating diagrams, like flowcharts or network diagrams, offers a visual snapshot of the system's architecture.
