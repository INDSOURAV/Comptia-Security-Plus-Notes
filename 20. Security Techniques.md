### Wireless Infrastructure Security
##### Wireless Access Point (WAP)
A wireless access point, also known as the WAP is a device that allow wireless device to connect to a wired network using the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard and protocols.
The placement of these wireless access point is important to consider in terms of achieving both optimal network performance and increased levels of security.
##### Extended Service Set (ESS) Configuration
Involves multiple wireless access points working together to create a unified and extended coverage are for users in a large building or facility.
##### Site Survey
Process of planning and designing a wireless network to provide a solution that will deliver the required wireless coverage, data rates, network capacity, roaming capability and quality of service levels.
##### Heat Map
Graphical representation of the wireless coverage, the signal strength, and frequency utilization data at different location on a map.
Heat map are really useful when you are trying to troubleshoot coverage issues or dead zone areas that have no coverage, as well as determining any areas where the signal strength is too strong.
### Wireless Security Settings
##### WPA3
Wireless encryption and cryptographical protocols protect wireless networks by securing data from interception.
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP):
  Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an outdated wireless security standard introduced in 1999 to give Wi-Fi networks a level of protection similar to wired LANs. WEP uses a fixed, shared encryption key for all devices on the network, meaning everyone connecting uses the same key value. It supports two key lengths: 64-bit WEP (40 bits of actual key + 24-bit Initialization Vector) and 128-bit WEP (104 bits of key + 24-bit IV).
  
  However, WEP is considered highly insecure because it relies on a weak 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV) that repeats frequently. Attackers can capture enough packets in just a few minutes and use modern tools to crack the WEP key, gaining full access to the network. Due to these flaws, WEP has been completely replaced by stronger standards like WPA2 and WPA3.
  
- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA):
  Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was introduced in 2003 as an interim solution to replace the insecure WEP standard while the stronger IEEE 802.11i specification was being finalized. WPA significantly improved wireless security by introducing TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), which dynamically generates a new 128-bit encryption key for every packet, preventing the key-reuse issues that made WEP easily crackable. However, WPA is still considered insecure today because TKIP lacks strong data integrity checks and relies on older cryptographic algorithms, making it vulnerable to modern attacks. As a result, WPA has been phased out in favor of WPA2 and WPA3, which use much stronger encryption mechanisms.

- Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2):
  Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) strengthened wireless security by fixing the weaknesses found in WPA and adopting more advanced encryption standards. Unlike WPA, which used TKIP, WPA2 uses AES encryption with the CCMP protocol, providing far stronger confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. WPA2 also includes a Message Integrity Code (MIC) to detect tampering and ensure that transmitted data has not been altered. However, despite its improvements, WPA2 was found vulnerable to the KRACK attack (Key Reinstallation Attack) in 2016, which showed that even strong security protocols can be compromised due to flaws in implementation rather than the encryption algorithm itself.
  
- Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3):
  Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is the latest and most secure Wi-Fi security standard, designed to address vulnerabilities found in WPA2. It still uses AES encryption, but introduces stronger authentication mechanisms, improved protection for public networks, and updated cryptographic protocols. WPA3 also includes Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), Enhanced Open/OWE, AES-GCMP, and Management Frame Protection, making wireless networks significantly harder to attack compared to previous versions.
  Features of WPA3:
    - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE):
      SAE replaces WPA2's PSK (Pre-Shared Key) method. It uses a secure password-based key exchange resistant to offline dictionary attacks. Even if an attacker captures the handshake, they cannot brute-force the Wi-Fi password offline. SAE also provides forward secrecy, meaning old data cannot be decrypted even if the password is later compromised.
    - Enhanced Open / Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE):
      OWE is designed for public/open networks (like cafés and airports). Traditional open Wi-Fi provides no encryption, but OWE automatically performs a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between client and access point, encrypting traffic without requiring a password. This protects users from passive eavesdropping on open hotspots.
    - AES-GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol):
      WPA3 replaces WPA2’s AES-CCMP with AES-GCMP, a more modern and secure cryptographic mode. 
        - WPA3-Personal uses AES-GCMP-128
        - WPA3-Enterprise uses AES-GCMP-192 for higher-grade security
     GCMP provides stronger encryption, faster performance, and improved integrity protection compared to older methods.
     - Management Frame Protection (MFP):
       WPA3 includes mandatory Protected Management Frames (PMF), preventing attackers from spoofing or manipulating Wi-Fi management frames. This stops attacks such as:
        - De-authentication/disassociation attacks
        - Fake access point or “Evil Twin” attacks
        - Session interruption attempts
     PMF ensures that communication between the client and access point stays secure and cannot be forced offline easily.
##### Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Protocol
Plays a vital role in network security by centralizing user authentication to permit only authorized users to access network resources.
##### Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
RADIUS is a centralized authentication protocol commonly used for network access control—especially for Wi-Fi, VPNs, and network devices. It uses UDP and combines authentication and authorization into a single process, meaning both are handled together. While RADIUS encrypts only the user’s password during transmission, other parts of the packet remain in plaintext, making it suitable mainly for access services rather than device administration. Organizations typically use RADIUS with 802.1X, enterprise Wi-Fi, and NAC solutions.
##### TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)
TACACS+, created by Cisco, is a more secure and flexible protocol used primarily for managing administrative access to routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices. It uses TCP for reliability and encrypts the entire packet, providing stronger security than RADIUS. Unlike RADIUS, TACACS+ separates authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), allowing granular control - for example, allowing an admin to run only certain commands on a device. This makes TACACS+ ideal for network device management in enterprise environments.

##### Authentication Methods
###### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
EAP is a flexible authentication framework used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections. It does not define how authentication happens but supports many authentication methods like certificates, passwords, tokens, and more. EAP is widely used in 802.1X enterprise Wi-Fi, enabling secure user and device authentication.
###### PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)
PEAP creates a TLS-encrypted tunnel between the client and authentication server before sending user credentials. It protects usernames and passwords from being intercepted. Only the server needs a certificate, making PEAP easier to deploy. Once the secure tunnel is formed, methods like MS-CHAPv2 are used to authenticate the user inside the tunnel.
###### EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security)
EAP-TTLS also creates a TLS-encrypted tunnel, but it is more flexible than PEAP because it allows various inner authentication methods, including PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, or even token-based authentication. Like PEAP, only the server certificate is required, making it easier to manage while still providing strong protection of user credentials.
###### EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
EAP-FAST, developed by Cisco, provides secure authentication without requiring certificates. Instead, it uses a PAC (Protected Access Credential), a cryptographic key shared between the client and server. After establishing trust using the PAC, it forms a secure tunnel similar to PEAP/TTLS and authenticates the user inside it. EAP-FAST is lightweight and designed for environments where managing certificates is difficult.
### Application Security
Critical aspect of software development that focuses on building applications that are secure by design.
1. Input Validation:
   Input validation ensures that all user-provided data is checked for correctness, format, and safety before being processed. This helps prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection by rejecting malicious or unexpected input.
   
2. Secure Cookies:
   Secure cookies use security attributes such as Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite to protect session data stored in the browser. These flags help prevent cookies from being stolen through XSS or sent in unsafe ways that expose them during attacks.
   
3. Static Code Analysis:
   Static code analysis examines source code without executing it to detect vulnerabilities, insecure functions, coding errors, or policy violations early in the development process. Tools scan the codebase to catch issues before deployment.
   
4. Dynamic Code Analysis:
   Dynamic analysis tests the application while it is running, simulating real-world usage to identify vulnerabilities that appear during execution. It can detect runtime flaws such as insecure session handling, memory corruption, or logic errors.
    - Fuzzing: 
      A dynamic application testing technique where a program is repeatedly fed with large amounts of random, malformed, or unexpected input to see how it behaves. The goal is to trigger crashes, memory corruption, or unexpected behavior that reveals hidden vulnerabilities. Fuzzing is widely used to uncover issues like buffer overflows, input-handling flaws, and logic errors that may not be detected through manual testing or static analysis.
    - Stress testing: 
      Evaluates how an application or system behaves under extreme load, such as very high traffic, excessive data input, or resource exhaustion. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, stability issues, and failure points to ensure the system can handle unexpected spikes without crashing. This helps improve reliability and resilience during real-world peak usage or attack scenarios like DDoS.

5. Code Signing:
   Code signing uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the software publisher and ensure the code has not been tampered with. When an application is code-signed, users can trust that the software is authentic and safe to install.
   
6. Sandboxing:
   Sandboxing isolates an application or process in a restricted environment where it has limited permissions and cannot affect the rest of the system. This ensures that even if the application is compromised, the attacker’s access and damage remain contained.
### Network Access Control (NAC)
Network Access Control (NAC) is used to protect your network from both known and unknown devices by scanning any devices to determine its current state of security prior to being allowed access to your network.

When a device attempts to connect, it is first placed into a quarantine or virtual holding area where NAC checks its security posture - such as antivirus status, OS patches, configuration, and policy compliance. If the device meets all requirements, it is granted full network access; if it fails, it is restricted and directed to a remediation zone to fix issues before being allowed onto the main network.
##### NAC Agents: Persistent vs. Non-Persistent:
Persistent Agents
A persistent NAC agent is a small software program installed permanently on the endpoint device. It continuously monitors the device’s security posture—such as antivirus status, patch levels, firewall settings—and sends updates to the NAC server. Persistent agents provide deeper visibility and real-time compliance checks.

Non-Persistent Agents
A non-persistent (or dissolvable) NAC agent is temporarily downloaded during the authentication process. It performs a one-time security check and then removes itself after the device is evaluated. This is useful for guest devices or unmanaged endpoints where permanent installation is not desired.

Network Access Control can be offered as a hardware or a software solution. One of the most commonly used Network Access Control mechanism is called IEEE Standard 802.1x, which is used in a port-based Network Access Control.

NAC can enforce policies based on location and time, allowing full access only when a user connects from trusted places—such as the corporate office—and during approved hours. If a login attempt occurs from an unusual location or outside business hours, NAC can restrict access, require additional authentication, or block the connection entirely.
##### Adaptive Network Access Control (NAC)
Adaptive Network Access Control (NAC) is a security solution that provides real-time, context-aware enforcement of access policies on networked devices. It evaluates access attempts using multiple parameters—such as user identity, device type, security posture, location, and time—to ensure that only authorized and compliant devices can access network resources.
### Web and DNS Filtering
##### Web Filtering
Technique used to restrict or control the content a user can access on the internet.
1. Agent-Based Web Filtering:
   In this method, a small software agent is installed on each endpoint device. It monitors and filters web traffic locally, enforcing browsing policies even when the device is outside the corporate network.
2. Centralized Proxies:
   All web traffic is routed through a central proxy server that inspects, filters, and logs requests. This provides consistent policy enforcement across the organization from a single control point.
3. URL Scanning:
   The filtering system analyzes requested URLs for malicious patterns, suspicious parameters, or known attack signatures before allowing access. This helps block phishing pages, malware sites, and harmful redirects.
4. Content Categorization:
   Websites are classified into categories - such as social media, gambling, adult content, or malware - and access is either allowed or blocked based on organizational policies.
5. Block Rules:
   Administrators create custom rules to explicitly block certain domains, keywords, file types, or protocols, ensuring granular control over web access.
6. Reputation-Based Filtering:
   The filtering system uses threat intelligence and reputation databases to block sites with poor trust scores, newly registered domains, or those known for hosting malware or phishing.
##### DNS Filtering
Technique used to block access to certain websites by preventing the translation of specific domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.
DNS filtering is a powerful tool for preventing access to malicious websites, and it is commonly used to enforce internet usage policies.
### Email Security
##### Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
Allows the receiver to check if the email was actually sent by the domain it claims to be sent from and if the content was tempered with during transit.
##### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
Email authentication method designed to prevent forging sender addresses during email delivery.
##### Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
An email-validation system designed to detect and prevent email spoofing. DMARC can work with either DKIM, SPF, or both.
Example:
A company example.com sets up a DMARC policy that instructs receiving email service to reject any emails that claim to come from example.com, but have already failed the DKIM or SPF checks.
##### Email Gateway Protocol
Server or system that serves as the entry and exit point for emails.
Email gateway protocols improve security by scanning, filtering, and controlling all inbound and outbound email traffic before it reaches the user. They help block spam, phishing attempts, malware attachments, and suspicious links by inspecting message headers, content, and sender reputation. These gateways also enforce policies such as attachment restrictions, data loss prevention (DLP), and encryption, ensuring that only safe and compliant emails enter or leave the organization.
##### Spam Filtering
Process of detecting unwanted and unsolicited emails and preventing them from reaching a user's email inbox based on content analysis, DNS-based sinkhole list, Bayesian filtering and general email filtering rules.
### Endpoint Detection and Response
##### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a security solution that continuously monitors endpoints - such as laptops, servers, and mobile devices—to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real time. It works by collecting detailed endpoint activity data, storing it for historical investigation, detecting suspicious behavior through analytics, triggering alerts when anomalies are found, enabling security teams to investigate the root cause, and finally performing remediation actions like isolating the device, killing malicious processes, or rolling back harmful changes.
##### File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
File Integrity Monitoring tracks changes to critical system files, configurations, and directories. It compares files against a known-good baseline and alerts security teams whenever unauthorized modifications occur. FIM helps detect malware tampering, insider threats, and configuration drift by monitoring file additions, deletions, or changes in real time.
##### Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
XDR expands beyond endpoint monitoring to combine data from multiple sources - such as endpoints, networks, cloud workloads, identity systems, and emails. It correlates these signals into a unified analytics platform to provide broader visibility and faster threat detection. XDR improves accuracy by reducing false positives and enables more coordinated, automated response actions across the entire environment.
### User Behavior Analytics
##### User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
User Behavior Analytics focuses on monitoring and analyzing how users normally behave—such as login patterns, access times, file activity, and network usage—to identify deviations that may indicate malicious or risky actions. By understanding a baseline of normal behavior, UBA can detect unusual activities like abnormal login locations, excessive file downloads, or privilege misuse.
##### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
UEBA is an expanded version of UBA that analyzes not only user behavior but also the behavior of entities such as devices, servers, applications, and network resources. It correlates user actions with machine and system activity to provide deeper visibility into potential threats, making it more effective against sophisticated attacks like insider threats, credential compromise, or lateral movement.
##### Benefits of UBA/UEBA
- Early Detection: Identifies unusual behavior at an early stage, even before signature-based tools detect anything.
- Insider Threat Detection: Helps catch malicious insiders, compromised accounts, or privilege abuse that traditional tools often miss.
- Improved Incident Response: Provides behavioral context and timelines, helping security teams quickly investigate and respond to threats.
### Selecting Secure Protocols
When devices communicate over a network, they use protocols (rules), ports (service identifiers), and transport methods (TCP/UDP).
Using unsecure protocols exposes data - like usernames, passwords, commands, and emails - because they transfer information in plain text. Attackers can easily intercept this using sniffing tools.

That’s why organizations must switch to secure alternatives, which encrypt data before sending it.
1. HTTP (80) → Sends web traffic in plain text; HTTPS (443) encrypts all web communication with TLS.
2. FTP (21) → Transfers files unencrypted; SFTP (22)/FTPS (990) securely transfer files using encryption.
3. SMTP (25) → Sends emails without encryption; SMTPS (465)/STARTTLS (587) encrypt outgoing email communication.
4. Telnet (23) → Remote login in plain text; SSH (22) provides encrypted remote administration.
5. IMAP (143) → Retrieves emails unencrypted; IMAPS (993) retrieves emails securely over TLS.
6. POP3 (110) → Downloads emails without encryption; POP3S (995) encrypts email retrieval.
7. SNMPv1/v2c (161/162) → Sends device management data in plain text; SNMPv3 encrypts and authenticates SNMP communications.
