Design, structure and behavior of an organization's information security environment, it encompasses various components such as hardware, software, processes, and people.
### On-premise versus the Cloud
##### Cloud
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet including servers, storage, databases, networking, software analytics, and intelligence.
This technology offers faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.

Now, within the cloud computing, there are a few concepts that you should be familiar with, such as responsibility matrix, third-party vendors and hybrid solutions.
- Responsibility Matrix:
  Outlines the division of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer.
- Third-Party Vendors:
  Provide specialized services that enhance the functionality, security and efficiency of cloud solutions.
  These services range from cloud management tools, security solutions to data analytic tool, such as cloud health by VMware provides cost management, governance, automation, and security for multi-cloud environment.
- Hybrid Solutions:
  Combine on-premise infrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud services.
  Example:
  A healthcare organization might use a hybrid solution to manage its IT needs, the organization could host sensitive patient data on its on-premise servers to maintain high level of control and security.
##### On- premise Solutions
Computing infrastructure that is physically located on-site at a business.
Example:
A small law firm might choose to keep all of its data and application on-premise due to the sensitive nature of the legal document and client information it handles. The firm has a server room where all the data is stored and managed.

Now, there are a few key considerations that you should be aware of in the cloud computing world:
- Availability:
  Ensures cloud services are accessible whenever needed with minimal downtime. High availability architectures use redundancy to prevent service interruptions.
- Resilience:
  The ability of cloud systems to quickly recover from failures and continue operating. This includes automated failover, backups, and multi-region deployments.
- Cost:
  Cloud uses a pay-as-you-go model, so organizations must control resource usage to avoid unexpected charges. Efficient workload planning helps reduce operational costs.
- Responsiveness:
  Measures how fast the cloud environment responds to user requests or system changes. Low latency and optimized infrastructure ensure a smooth user experience.
- Scalability:
  Allows systems to automatically increase or decrease resources based on demand. This helps handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.
- Ease of Deployment:
  Cloud platforms provide automated provisioning, templates, and CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications quickly and consistently.
- Risk Transference:
  Shifting certain security and operational risks to the cloud provider, who manages infrastructure, physical security, and some compliance responsibilities.
- Patch Availability:
  Cloud vendors often release timely patches for vulnerabilities in their managed services, helping organizations stay secure with minimal effort.
- Inability to Path:
  In some managed services, customers cannot directly patch underlying infrastructure, relying entirely on the provider for updates and fixes.
- Power:
  Cloud environments ensure uninterrupted power supply through redundant systems, reducing the risk of outages compared to on-premises setups.
- Compute:
  Refers to the processing power available in the cloud - virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions - that can be provisioned on demand based on workload needs.
### Cloud Security
1. Shared Physical Server Vulnerabilities:
   Multiple customers share the same physical hardware, so flaws in hypervisors or isolation mechanisms can expose one tenant’s data to another.
2. Inadequate Virtual Environment Security:
   Weak VM configurations, unpatched hypervisors, or insecure virtualization layers can allow attackers to compromise virtual machines or move laterally.
3. User Access Management:
   Poorly managed user permissions, excessive privileges, or lack of MFA can lead to unauthorized access and cloud account takeover.
4. Lack of Up-to-date Security Measures:
   Systems without timely patches, threat detection, or updated configurations increase the risk of exploitation in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
5. Single Point of Failure:
   If critical services rely on one region, instance, or provider component, an outage can take down the entire application or workload.
6. Weak Authentication and Encryption Practices:
   Using weak credentials or failing to encrypt data in transit and at rest exposes sensitive information to interception or unauthorized access.
7. Unclear Policies:
   Ambiguous or poorly defined security policies can lead to inconsistent configurations, gaps in responsibility, and compliance issues.
8. Data Remnants:
   Residual data left behind after storage de-allocation or improper deletion can potentially be recovered by unauthorized parties.
### Virtualization and Containerization
##### Virtualization
Technology that allows for the emulation of server.
##### Containerization
Lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization.

Virtual machine operate on a platform known as a hypervisor, which manages the distribution of the physical server's resources, such as processor, memory, and hard disk space among the virtual machines. 
Hypervisors come in two main types, Type 1 and Type 2.
- Type 1: 
  A bare-metal hypervisor that runs directly on the host’s physical hardware, acting like an operating system to manage virtual machines efficiently with high performance such as VMware ESXi and Xen.
- Type 2: Runs on top of a standard operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS), making it easier to use but generally slower due to the extra OS layer underneath such as VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.

Type 1 hypervisor is faster and efficient than a type 2 hypervisors.

There are some unique vulnerabilities that can exploited by attackers:
1. VM Escape:
   VM Escape occurs when an attacker inside a virtual machine breaks out of the VM’s isolation layer and gains access to the host system or other VMs running on the same hypervisor. This compromises the entire virtualization stack and allows an attacker to control multiple systems from a single exploit.
2. Privilege Elevation:
   This happens when an attacker exploits flaws or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges than they should have-such as moving from a normal user to admin, or from a VM to hypervisor-level permissions. Once elevated, the attacker can modify configurations, access sensitive data, or take over cloud resources.
3. Live VM Migration:
   Live migration allows VMs to move between physical hosts with no downtime, but if migration traffic is not encrypted, attackers can intercept or manipulate data during transit. This could expose memory contents, session data, or even enable takeover of the migrated VM.
4. Resources Reuse:
   Cloud providers frequently reassign resources like memory pages, storage blocks, or CPU cache to new tenants. If these resources are not properly wiped before reuse, attackers may recover residual data that belonged to previous users, leading to data leakage.

Secure virtual machines:
- Update the operating system in the applications
- Ensures that each virtual machine has a good antivirus solution installed
- Good strong passwords and good policies
- Limit the connections between VMs and the physical machines
- Minimize and remove any unneeded features to support operations
### Serverless
Serverless is a cloud computing model where developers focus only on writing code, while the cloud provider manages the servers, operating systems, databases, scaling, and infrastructure. It automatically handles capacity, scaling, and maintenance, allowing teams to deploy functions quickly without worrying about backend management.
##### Vendor Lock-in
Vendor lock-in occurs when an organization becomes heavily dependent on a particular cloud provider’s proprietary services, APIs, or functions, making it difficult and costly to migrate to another platform. In serverless architectures, this risk increases because functions, event triggers, and workflows often rely deeply on provider-specific tools and configurations.
### Microservices
A software architecture where large applications are broken down into smaller and independent services, unlike in monolithic architecture, each service in microservices architecture is self-contained and able to tun independently.
Microservices offer several advantages over traditional monolithic architectures:
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Resilience
- Faster Deployment and Updates

Challenges with Microservices:
- Complexity:
  Microservices introduce architectural complexity as multiple independent services must coordinate with each other, requiring robust orchestration, monitoring, and communication mechanisms.
- Data Management:
  Each service often maintains its own database, making data consistency, transactions, and synchronization harder to manage compared to a monolithic system.
- Network Latency:
  Since microservices communicate over the network (API calls, REST, gRPC), increased service-to-service traffic can lead to latency issues and impact overall performance.
- Security:
  With many exposed endpoints and services communicating across networks, the attack surface grows significantly, requiring strong authentication, authorization, encrypted communication, and API security.
### Network Infrastructure
Network infrastructure is the backbone of any modern organization. It comprises the hardware, software, services, and facilities required to support manage and operate an enterprise network. A critical aspect of network infrastructure is the separation of network components, which can be achieved either physically or logically.
- Physical Separation / Air-Gaps:
  Physical separation (air-gapping) involves completely isolating a network so it has no direct or indirect connection to any other network, including the internet. It is one of the strongest security measures, but still not foolproof, as advanced attackers may exploit removable media, compromised supply chains, or insider threats to bypass the isolation.
- Logical Separation:
  Logical separation uses software-based methods such as VLANs, firewalls, subnets, or access control policies - to create isolated segments within the same physical network. It restricts traffic and access to specific areas, but must be properly configured and maintained to prevent misconfigurations or unintended cross-communication.
  
  A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical network created within a physical network to segment devices into separate broadcast domains. It helps improve security, reduce unnecessary network traffic, and organize systems based on function—without needing separate physical switches.
### Software-Defined Network (SDN)
Software-Defined Networking is an approach that simplifies and modernizes network management by separating the network’s control functions from the devices that forward traffic. Instead of configuring each switch or router manually, SDN provides a centralized, programmable platform that allows administrators to manage the entire network through software.

SDN reduces the complexity of traditional, static, and hardware-dependent networks by giving a unified and centralized view of all network components. This enables faster configuration, better performance, and easier monitoring.

How SDN Works
SDN achieves flexibility by decoupling the network into three distinct planes:
1. Data Plane (Forwarding Plane):
    - This plane consists of switches and routers that handle actual packet forwarding.
    - It simply receives instructions from the control plane about how traffic should flow.
    - Its job is to forward packets based on predefined rules - no high-level decision-making happens here.
2. Control Plane:
    - This is the “brain” of the SDN network.
    - It decides how traffic should be routed and what policies should be applied.
    - In SDN, the control plane is centralized in an SDN controller, which sends forwarding rules to all devices in the data plane.
3. Application Plane:
    - This layer contains the applications that communicate with the SDN controller, such as firewalls, load balancers, monitoring tools, and network automation systems.
    - It allows administrators to define policies and network behavior through software, without touching the underlying hardware.

In SDN, the application plane defines policies → the control plane makes decisions → the data plane forwards packets accordingly.
This architecture provides flexibility, programmability, centralized control, and easier network management compared to traditional networking.
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
A method in which IT infrastructure are defined in code files that can be versioned, tested, and audited.
The code can be written using high level languages such as YAML, JSON, or domain-specific languages like HashiCorp Configuration Language, or HCL.
Example:
A developer might write a script that automatically sets up a server, installs necessary software, and deploy an application(this known as idempotence).
##### Snowflake System
A configuration that lacks consistency that might introduce risks, so it has to be eliminated in IaC.
##### Idempotence
The ability of an operation to produce the same results as many times as it is executed.

Challenges in IaC:
- Learning Curve
- Complexity
- Security Risks
### Centralized vs Decentralized Architectures
##### Centralized
All the computing functions are coordinated and managed from a single location or authority.
Risk:
- Single point of failure
- Scalability issues
- Security risks
##### Decentralized
Computing functions are distributed across multiple systems or locations.
Risk:
- Security risk
- Management challenges
- Data inconsistency

The choice between the two system architectures depends on the specific needs of the organization.
### Internet of Things (IoT)
Refers to the network of physical items with embedded systems that enables connection and data exchange.
- Hub:
  The central point connecting all IoT devices and sends commands to them, such as mobile phone.
- Smart Devices:
  Everyday objects enhanced with computing capabilities and internet connectivity.
- Wearables:
  Subset of smart devices designed to be worn on the body.
- Sensors:
  Detect changes in the environment and transform them into analyzable data.

Security risk in IoT:
- Weak default settings
- Poorly configured network services
### ICS and SCADA
##### Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
Control system used to monitor and control industrial processes ranging from simple systems to complex systems.
Example:
ICS include Distributed Control System and Programmable Logic Control, Distributed Control System or DCS are used to control production system within a single location and Programmable Logic Controller are used to control specific process system, assembly line, and factory.
##### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
A type of ICS used to monitor and control geographically dispersed industrial processes.
Example:
- Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution systems
- Water treatment and distribution systems
- Oil and gas pipeline monitoring and control systems

Risk with SCADA:
- Unauthorized
- Malware Attacks
- Lacks of Updates
- Physical Threats
Solutions:
- Strong access controls
- Regular updates and system patches
- Firewall and intrusion detection systems
- Regular security audits
- Employee training
### Embedded Systems
Specialized computing component designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger structure.
##### Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
Ensures data processing in real-time and is crucial for time-sensitive applications

Risk with Embedded Systems:
- Hardware failure
- Software bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Outdated systems

There are 4 key strategies in securing Embedded systems:
- Network Segmentation:
  Separating embedded devices into isolated network zones to limit their exposure. Even if one device is compromised, segmentation prevents attackers from moving laterally to other systems.
- Firmware Code Control:
  Ensuring only trusted, verified, and digitally signed firmware can run on the device. This prevents attackers from installing malicious or unauthorized firmware updates.
- Wrappers:
  Using protective layers - such as secure APIs, encryption layers, or gateway devices - that sit between the embedded system and external networks. Wrappers add security features without modifying the device itself.
- Inability to Patch:
  Many embedded devices cannot be easily updated, so security relies on preventing exposure, restricting access, and placing the device behind strong compensating controls. The focus is on protecting the device since patching is not feasible.
