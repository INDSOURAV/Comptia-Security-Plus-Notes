Refers to the knowledge and understanding of potential threats and the measures that can be taken to mitigate or prevent them.
### Recognizing Insider Threats
Recognizing insider threats means closely watching for behavioral or technical warning signs—such as unusual access patterns, policy violations, or sudden changes in employee behavior—and having clear procedures to respond quickly and appropriately. At the same time, it’s about creating a supportive workplace where employees feel safe reporting concerns or seeking help, and where the organization puts proactive measures in place, like training, monitoring, and access controls, to reduce the overall risk of insider-driven incidents.
### Password Management
##### Password Manager
A specialized tool that is used with a web browser to remember all the different usernames and passwords for all the various sites.
### Avoiding Social Engineering
A manipulative tactic used by attackers to trick individuals into bypassing an organization's security procedures.
##### Situational Awareness
Being mindful of surroundings, tasks, and the potential consequences of one's actions.
##### Shoulder Surfing:
Shoulder surfing involves someone observing your screen or keystrokes to steal sensitive information. To avoid it, use privacy screens, stay aware of your surroundings, and avoid entering sensitive data in crowded or public places.
##### Eavesdropping:
Eavesdropping occurs when someone listens to private conversations to gather confidential information. Avoid it by discussing sensitive topics only in secure areas and using encrypted communication channels when talking digitally.
##### Piggybacking/Tailgating:
This happens when an unauthorized person follows an authorized employee into a secure area without proper authentication. Prevent it by ensuring doors close behind you, never letting strangers follow in, and reporting suspicious behavior.
##### Dumpster Diving:
Dumpster diving involves retrieving discarded documents or devices to extract sensitive information. Prevent it by shredding confidential papers, securely wiping devices before disposal, and using locked disposal bins.
##### Operational Security (OPSEC):
OPSEC ensures that sensitive information is not unintentionally exposed through daily activities. Improve OPSEC by limiting what you share publicly, securing workstations, and consistently following security policies.
##### Removable Devices/Cables:
Attackers may steal or plant malicious USB drives or cables to gain access. Avoid this by never using untrusted devices, keeping removable media locked away, and disabling USB ports if not needed.

- Foster a culture of security with regular cybersecurity training
- Educate all employees on recognizing phishing attempts and valuing data privacy
- Encourage employees to report suspicious activities
- Conduct practical exercises like simulated phishing attack
- Remediate individuals who fall for simulated attacks

Each person guards data against social engineering and vigilance is crucial to an organization's defense.
### Policy and Handbooks
##### Policy:
A policy is a formal, high-level set of rules or guidelines that an organization creates to govern behavior, security, and operations. It defines what must be done but not necessarily how to do it.
Example: A Password Policy may require employees to use strong passwords, change them every 90 days, and never share them with others.
##### Handbook:
A handbook is a practical, user-friendly document that explains day-to-day procedures, expectations, and best practices for employees. It provides detailed guidance on how to follow company policies.
Example: An Employee Handbook may describe how to request leave, workplace rules, dress code, reporting procedures, or steps on how to reset a password according to the organization’s password policy.
### Remote and Hybrid Work Environment
In a remote and hybrid work environment, employees access corporate data from various locations and networks, increasing the attack surface for cyber threats. To maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of organizational information, companies must adopt strong security practices that protect data, devices, communication, and user access in these distributed setups.
Security Measures for Remote and Hybrid Work:
- Emphasize the use of secure connections, such as VPNs, to protect data traveling over public or untrusted networks.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to strengthen access control and reduce unauthorized login attempts.
- Educate employees on current cybersecurity trends and promote a culture that prioritizes security awareness.
- Use company-issued devices with updated security software to ensure consistent protection and reduce risks from unmanaged personal systems.
- Enable automated data backups to prevent data loss and support recovery in case of incidents like ransomware.
- Select secure collaboration tools that offer end-to-end encryption and meet compliance requirements.
- Maintain clear communication between cybersecurity teams and remote employees to support quick issue resolution, policy enforcement, and security audits.

As remote and hybrid work grow, securing assets beyond the office is paramount.
### Creating a Culture of Security
Creating a Culture of Security means ensuring that security is not just a technical function but a shared responsibility across the entire organization. It focuses on building awareness, encouraging proactive behavior, and reinforcing good security practices so that employees become active participants in protecting corporate assets. A strong security culture helps reduce risks, improves incident response, and strengthens the overall security posture.
Key elements of creating a security-focused culture:
- Conduct initial monitoring after rolling out a security program to ensure controls are working as intended.
- Perform recurring check-ins to maintain program integrity and identify potential gaps over time.
- Educate employees on how to recognize and report suspicious activities effectively.
- Encourage an environment where reporting security concerns is valued, supported, and free of blame.
- Establish a feedback loop to gather insights from incidents and user input, using them to drive continuous improvement.

Creating a security culture enhances an organization's cyber resilience and long-term readiness against cyber threats.
