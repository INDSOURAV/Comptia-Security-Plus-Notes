- Potential security and operational challenges introduced by external entities such as vendor, supplier or security providers
- When we integrate external partners into our operational ecosystem, we open up our avenues for potential threats and vulnerabilities that could affect our organization's integrity, data security and overall business continuity.
### Supply Chain Risks
Supply Chain Risks can arise at different stages depending on who provides the component or service:
1. Hardware Manufactures
2. Software Developer
3. Service Provider (MSP)

Explanations:
1. Hardware Manufactures:
    - Organizations should conduct rigorous supply chain assessments to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of hardware vendors.
    - Hardware components may contain compromised or counterfeit parts, malicious implants, or firmware-level backdoors, or may be sourced from non-transparent manufacturing locations, all of which can introduce serious security vulnerabilities.
    - An often overlooked risk is the procurement of hardware from secondary or after market sources, it can be cost-effective, but devices may have been tampered with, modified, or lack proper security validation.
      
2. Software Developer:
    - Software developers and software providers are integral components of the supply chain, and weaknesses at this stage can directly impact organizational security.
    - Software must be properly licensed and verified for authenticity, and should be assessed to ensure it is free from known vulnerabilities, bugs, or insecure dependencies.
    - All software should be scanned using updated antivirus and security tools to ensure it does not contain malicious or unauthorized code before deployment. (if using open-source software, you can review the source code)
      
3. Service Provider (MSP):
    - Organizations must evaluate the service provider’s data security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of sensitive information.
    - It is essential to assess the cybersecurity controls, policies, and protocols implemented by the Managed Service Provider (MSP), including access management, monitoring, and data protection practices.
    - The organization should review the service provider’s incident response capabilities, ensuring they have clearly defined procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security breaches in a timely and coordinated manner.
### Supply Chain Attack
Attack that involve targeting a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target.
Example: 
The SolarWinds 2021 attack was a supply chain attack where malicious code was inserted into a trusted software update, allowing attackers to compromise thousands of organizations and highlighting the risks of relying on third-party vendors.

- Chip Washing:
  Chip washing is the practice of relabeling or refurbishing counterfeit, recycled, or modified chips and selling them as new and genuine components. These chips may be old, defective, or tampered with, which can lead to system failures, hidden vulnerabilities, or intentional backdoors in hardware devices.
  
- Embedding Rootkit in device by overseas supplier:
  This involves inserting malicious code at the firmware or hardware level during manufacturing or supply by untrusted or overseas vendors. The rootkit operates below the operating system, making it extremely difficult to detect or remove.
  
How to safeguard your organization against supply chain attack:
- Vendor Due Diligence:
  Perform thorough background checks, security assessments, and risk evaluations of vendors and suppliers.
- Regular Monitoring and Audits:
  Continuously monitor supplier security posture and conduct periodic audits to detect anomalies or non-compliance.
- Education and Collaboration:
  Educate employees and partners about supply chain risks and maintain strong collaboration with vendors on security practices.
- Incorporating Contractual Safeguards:
  Include security requirements, audit rights, incident notification clauses, and compliance obligations within vendor contracts.
### Vendor Assessment
Process that organizations implement to evaluate the security, reliability and performance of external entities.
Primary entities under Vendor Assessment:
1. Vendor:
   Businesses or individuals that provide goods or services to an organization.
2. Supplier:
   Individual involved in the production and delivery of products or parts of product.
3. MSP:
   Individual hired by companies to manage IT services on behalf of an organization.
##### Penetration Testing:
A simulated cyberattack conducted on the supplier’s systems to identify exploitable vulnerabilities, security weaknesses, and potential attack paths before they can be abused by real attackers.
##### Contract Review:
The right-to-audit clause grants organizations the authority to evaluate vendor security practices. 
For example, if a company contracts a data management firm to handle customer data, this clause allows the organization to periodically inspect the vendor’s data handling, storage, and protection practices to ensure compliance with agreed security standards.
##### Internal Audit:
A vendor self-assessment in which the supplier evaluates its own security controls and operational practices against industry standards (such as ISO or NIST) or the organization’s security requirements.

While internal audits are commendable, they may sometimes be insufficient, especially if they lack the required rigor or objectivity. In such cases, an independent assessment becomes necessary.
##### Independent Assessment:
An evaluation conducted by neutral third-party entities that have no vested interest in the organization’s or vendor’s operations. This provides an unbiased and objective view of the vendor’s security posture and control effectiveness.
##### Supply Chain Analysis:
A process used to examine a vendor’s entire supply chain, assessing the security and reliability of each link. 
For example, when selecting a hardware vendor, this includes verifying suppliers across different geographic locations to ensure there is no risk of counterfeit components or tampered products entering the supply chain.
### Vendor Selection and Monitoring
Vendor selection should involve a rigorous evaluation that goes beyond surface-level credentials, including an assessment of the vendor’s financial stability, operational history, client testimonials, and on-the-ground security and operational practices to ensure long-term reliability and trustworthiness.
##### Conflict of Interest:
Arises when personal or financial relationships could potentially cloud the judgment of an individual involved in vendor selection.
##### Vendor Questionnaires:
Comprehensive documents completed by potential vendors to provide insights into their operations, technical capabilities, security controls, and regulatory compliance.
Example: When selecting a cloud service provider, questionnaires may cover areas such as data redundancy measures, security protocols, uptime guarantees, and disaster recovery plans.
##### Rules of Engagement:
Defined guidelines that govern interactions between an organization and its vendors. These include communication protocols, data-sharing requirements, escalation paths, and negotiation boundaries to ensure clarity and control.
##### Monitoring:
Ongoing mechanisms used to verify that the selected vendor continues to meet organizational requirements, security standards, and service-level agreements (SLAs) over time.
##### Feedback Loops:
A two-way communication process where both the organization and the vendor regularly share feedback to address issues, improve performance, and strengthen the partnership.
### Contract and Agreements
1. Basic Contract
   A legal agreement that officially defines a relationship between two parties. It states what each party agrees to do and protects both sides if something goes wrong.

2. Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
   A document that clearly explains what level of service a customer should expect. It includes things like system uptime, response time, and what happens if the service falls below expectations.

3. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
   A formal agreement that clearly assigns roles and responsibilities to each party, ensuring everyone understands their obligations.

4. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
   A less formal and often non-binding document that shows mutual intent to work together. It’s commonly used in early stages before signing a full contract.

5. Master Service Agreement (MSA)
   A broad agreement that sets the general rules and terms for an ongoing relationship, allowing multiple projects or transactions without renegotiating terms each time.

6. Statement of Work (SOW)
   A project-specific document that explains exactly what work will be done, including deliverables, timelines, milestones, and success criteria.

7. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
   An agreement that protects confidential information, ensuring that sensitive data shared during discussions or projects is not disclosed to others.

8. Business Partnership Agreement (BPA) / Joint Venture (JV)
   A formal agreement used when two or more organizations decide to work together closely, share resources, risks, and profits to achieve a common business goal.
