Identity and Access Management (IAM) or IAM is a crucial component of information security that ensures that the right individual have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons.

IAM technologies provide tools for business processes that facilitate the management of electronic identities, including password management, network access control.
An Identity and Access Management system usually consists of four main processes:
- Identification: Claims a username or email as an identity.
- Authentication: Verifies the user's identity, device, or system.
- Authorization: Establishes the user's access permissions or levels.
- Accounting/Auditing: Involves monitoring and recording user actions for compliance and security records.
##### Provisioning
Process of creating new user accounts, assigning them appropriate permissions, and providing users with access to the system.
##### De-provisioning
Process of removing an individual's access rights when the rights are no longer required.
##### Identity Proofing
Process of verifying the identity of a user before the account is created.
##### Interoperability
The ability of different systems, devices, and applications to work together and share information.
##### Attestation
Process of validating that user accounts and access rights are correct and up-to-date.
### Multifactor Authentication
Security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity.

Multifactor authentication revolves around the concept of combining at least two or more independent credentials from across five different categories of authentication:
1. Knowledge-based Factor (something you know):
   Knowledge-based information that the user must provide to authenticate their identity, such as password, pin, passphrase and security questions.
   
2. Possession-based Factor (something you have):
   Something the user physically possesses like a smart card, a hardware token like a key fob, or a software token used with a smartphone (authenticator apps or OTPs).
   
3. Inherence-based Factor (something you are):
   Involves biometric characteristics that are unique to individuals, including fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition or iris scans.
   
4. Behavior-based Factor (something you do):
   Recognizing patterns that are typically associated with a user, such as their keystroke patterns, mouse movement, or even the way a user walks downs the hallway.
   
5. Location-based Factor (somewhere you are):
   Involves determining a user's location to help authenticate them.
### Password Security
Measures the password's ability to resist guessing and brute-force attacks.
Characteristics that you need to consider, when managing your organization's password policies:
- Password Length – Longer passwords are significantly harder to crack.
- Password Complexity – Use a mix of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to increase difficulty.
- Password Reuse – Prevent users from reusing old passwords to reduce risk from previously compromised credentials.
- Password Expiration – Define when passwords must be changed, especially after suspected compromise.
- Password Age – Control how frequently users are allowed to change their passwords to avoid weak, predictable patterns.

##### Password Manager
A password manager is a security tool that securely stores, organizes, and manages your passwords and sensitive credentials. Instead of remembering multiple complex passwords, you only need to remember one master password to access your encrypted password vault. This helps improve security and reduces the risk of weak or reused passwords.

Features:
- Password Generation:
  A password manager can automatically create strong, unique, and complex passwords for every account you use. These passwords are typically long, random, and difficult to guess, helping protect against brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. By generating unique passwords, it eliminates the risk of password reuse across multiple services.
- Autofill:
  Password managers can securely autofill login credentials on websites and applications. This makes the login process faster and reduces the chance of typing errors. Autofill also provides security benefits, as many managers only fill credentials on legitimate sites, helping protect against phishing attacks.
- Secure Sharing:
  Many password managers allow secure sharing of passwords or sensitive information with trusted individuals without revealing the actual password in plain text. The sharing process is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot read it. This is useful for sharing Wi-Fi credentials, team accounts, or temporary access.
- Cross-Platform Access:
  Password managers sync your encrypted vault across all your devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Whether you're on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS, you can access your passwords seamlessly. This ensures you always have your credentials available regardless of the device or platform you're using.
##### Password-less Authentication
Password-less authentication is a method of verifying a user’s identity without requiring a traditional password. Instead, it uses more secure and user-friendly factors like biometrics, hardware devices, temporary codes, or cryptographic keys. This reduces the risk of password theft, phishing, reuse, and brute-force attacks while improving user convenience.

- Biometric Authentication:
  Biometric authentication uses a person’s unique biological traits—such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or voice—to verify identity. Since these traits cannot be easily stolen or replicated, biometrics offer strong security and a quick, seamless login experience.
- Hardware Token:
  A hardware token is a physical device used to prove identity, such as a USB security key or smart card. These devices use cryptographic operations to authenticate the user when connected or tapped. Since the token must be physically possessed, it provides strong protection against remote attacks.
- One-Time Passwords (OTPs):
  OTPs are temporary codes sent to the user—often via SMS, email, or authenticator apps—that must be entered during login. Because the code is valid only once and for a short time, it reduces the risk of credential compromise. OTPs are commonly used as a secondary or password-less authentication option.
- Magic Links:
  Magic links are authentication links sent to the user’s email. Instead of typing a password, the user simply clicks the link to log in. The link is single-use and time-limited, offering a convenient and secure password-less experience, especially for web-based services.
- Passkeys:
  Passkeys are cryptographic credentials stored on a user’s device, replacing passwords entirely. They use public–private key pairs: the private key stays securely on the device, while the service keeps the public key. Authentication happens via biometrics or device unlock. Passkeys prevent phishing, replay attacks, and credential theft.
### Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack
2. Dictionary Attack
3. Spraying Attack
4. Hybrid Attack

Explanations:
1. Brute Force Attack:
   A brute force attack is a method where an attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. It does not rely on logic or wordlists—just pure computation. Weak or short passwords are highly vulnerable because the attacker can exhaust all combinations quickly.
   Example:
   If a user’s password is “cat12”, an attacker might try thousands of combinations like aaa1, abc2, cat12 until the correct one is matched.
   
2. Dictionary Attack:
   A dictionary attack uses a pre-built list of common words, passwords, or leaked credentials to guess the password. Attackers assume users often choose predictable words or patterns, making this attack faster than brute force.
   Example:
   An attacker tries passwords from a list like:
   Password1, qwerty123, welcome2024, iloveyou
   If the user’s password is “welcome2024”, it gets cracked easily.

3. Password Spraying Attack:
   Password spraying attempts a few common passwords across many user accounts. This avoids account lockouts because the attacker tries one password per user, instead of many attempts on one user.
   Example:
   An attacker tries “Winter@123” or “Password@123” across hundreds of corporate accounts.
   If any employee uses that weak password, the attacker gains access without triggering lockout.

4. Hybrid Attack:
   A hybrid attack combines dictionary words + brute force variations, such as adding numbers, symbols, or slight capitalization changes. It is effective because many users create passwords based on common words with simple modifications.
   Example:
   Starting with the dictionary word “summer”, the attacker generates guesses like:
   Summer1, summer2024, Summer@123, sUmMeR!
   If the user’s password is “Summer2024!”, this method cracks it faster than pure brute force.
### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or websites by logging in only once with a single set of credentials.
##### Identity Provider (IdP)
An Identity Provider is a system responsible for verifying a user’s identity and managing authentication credentials. Applications trust the IdP to confirm whether a user is authenticated instead of storing or validating passwords themselves.
Example: Active Directory or Azure AD authenticating users for multiple enterprise apps.
##### How SSO Works
SSO works by authenticating the user once with the Identity Provider. When the user accesses another trusted application, that application requests authentication confirmation from the IdP rather than prompting the user again.
Example: After logging into AD, accessing SharePoint without being asked for credentials again.
##### Benefits of SSO
SSO improves user experience by reducing login fatigue and password confusion. It also improves productivity, lowers IT support costs due to fewer password resets, and enhances security by encouraging stronger passwords.
Example: Help desk receive fewer “forgot password” tickets.
##### Mechanisms used to achieve SSO
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):
  LDAP is a directory-based authentication and authorization protocol used to centrally store and manage user identities, groups, and resources within an organization. When a user attempts to log in, the application queries the LDAP directory to verify the username and password and can also retrieve authorization details such as group membership or roles. LDAP is commonly used in internal enterprise environments and can operate securely using LDAPS, which encrypts authentication data.
  Example: An employee logs into a Linux server, and the server verifies the credentials against the company’s LDAP directory.
  
- OAuth with OAuth Tokens (JWT):
  OAuth is a token-based authorization framework that allows users to grant applications limited access to their data without sharing passwords. Instead of credentials, OAuth uses access tokens, commonly in the form of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are digitally signed and contain user and permission information. These tokens are presented to resource servers to prove authorization, making OAuth ideal for cloud services, APIs, and third-party application access.
  Example: Logging into a website using your Google account, where Google issues a JWT token that allows the site to access your basic profile information.
  
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):
  SAML is a federated authentication standard that enables applications to rely on an external Identity Provider to authenticate users. Instead of validating usernames and passwords themselves, applications trust SAML assertions sent by the Identity Provider confirming the user’s identity. SAML is widely used in enterprise single sign-on environments and is especially common for integrating cloud applications with corporate identity systems.
  Example: An employee accesses a cloud HR application and is automatically logged in after being authenticated by the company’s SSO portal.
### Federation
Federation is an identity and access management concept that allows users to access systems across multiple organizations using a single set of credentials from their home organization. Instead of creating separate accounts, organizations trust each other’s identity systems through a pre-established relationship.
Federation commonly uses protocols like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect to securely exchange authentication information between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP).

The main benefits of federation include a simplified user experience, reduced administrative overhead since external users don’t need local accounts, and improved security by minimizing password reuse and credential exposure.
##### Federation Authentication Process
1. Login Initiation:
   The federation process starts when a user attempts to access a federated application or service. The system recognizes the request as a federated login based on the user’s domain or login selection.
2. Redirection to Identity Provider (IdP):
   The service provider redirects the user to their home Identity Provider, which is responsible for managing and validating the user’s credentials.
3. User Authentication:
   The Identity Provider authenticates the user using credentials such as a username and password, often combined multifactor authentication for added security.
4. Assertion Generation:
   Once authentication is successful, the Identity Provider generates an assertion or token containing the user’s identity and authentication status, using protocols like SAML or OpenID Connect.
5. Return to Service Provider:
   The user is redirected back to the service provider along with the assertion issued by the trusted Identity Provider.
6. Verification and Access:
   The service provider verifies the assertion and, if valid, grants the user access to the requested service or application, completing the federation process.
### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a security solution used to restrict, control, and monitor privileged accounts such as administrator or root accounts. These accounts have elevated permissions and, if misused or compromised, can lead to serious security breaches. PAM enforces the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have the access they need to perform their tasks.

PAM includes policies, procedures, and technical controls designed to prevent abuse of privileged accounts and reduce risks caused by excessive or poorly managed permissions. It is a critical part of an organization’s overall security framework.
##### Key Components of Privileged Access Management
- Just-In-Time (JIT) Permissions:
  Just-In-Time permissions grant administrative access only when required and for a limited time. Once the task is completed, the privileges are automatically revoked, reducing the attack surface and preventing continuous privileged access.
  Example: An admin receives temporary access to patch a server, and access is removed immediately after.
- Password Vaulting:
  Password vaulting securely stores privileged account credentials in an encrypted digital vault, usually protect multifactor authentication. Access to credentials is logged and monitored, ensuring accountability and preventing password exposure.
  Example: Administrators retrieve root or admin passwords from a secure vault instead of knowing them permanently.
- Temporal Accounts:
  Temporal (temporary) accounts are created for short-term access and are automatically disabled or deleted after a defined period. This prevents unused accounts from becoming security risks.
  Example: A contractor receives a temporary account for a project, which is removed once the project ends.
### Access Control Models
Access control models define how users are granted or denied access to resources within a system. Organizations use different models based on security requirements, scalability, and administrative control.
##### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Mandatory Access Control uses security labels assigned to both users and resources. Access decisions are enforced by a central authority, not by users, and anything not explicitly allowed is denied. MAC is commonly used in high-security environments like military or government systems.
Example: A user with Secret clearance cannot access Top Secret files.
##### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Discretionary Access Control allows the resource owner to decide who can access their data. Access is based on user identity and is flexible, but less secure than MAC because permissions can be easily shared.
Example: Sharing a file with specific users on a corporate network.
##### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions based on a user’s job role rather than individual identity. Users inherit permissions from roles or groups, making RBAC easy to manage in large organizations with frequent employee changes.
Example: Accounting and HR departments have access to different systems.
##### Rule-Based Access Control
Rule-Based Access Control enforces access through administrator-defined rules that apply to all users. These rules are often implemented in network devices and can be quickly modified.
Example: Firewall or router access control lists (ACLs).
##### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Attribute-Based Access Control makes access decisions based on attributes of the user, environment, and resource. This model is very flexible and context-aware.
Example: Access depends on user role, login location, time, and data sensitivity.
##### Additional Access Control Restrictions
- Time-of-Day Restrictions:
  Time-of-day restrictions limit access to systems based on specific time windows. This adds an extra security layer and helps reduce insider threats during off-hours.
  Example: Blocking logins outside business hours like midnight access attempts.
- Principle of Least Privilege:
  The principle of least privilege ensures users are given only the minimum access required to perform their job. This limits damage from mistakes, insider threats, or compromised accounts.
  Example: A read-only database user cannot modify data.
- Permission (Authorization) Creep:
  Permission creep occurs when users accumulate excessive permissions as they change roles over time. Regular permission reviews are required to remove outdated access.
  Example: An employee retains old department access after promotion.
##### User Account Control (UAC) 
UAC is a Windows security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system by requiring explicit approval before actions that need administrative privileges are performed. Even if a user is logged in, UAC ensures that programs cannot automatically make system-level changes without the user’s knowledge.
Example:
When you try to install new software or change important system settings on Windows, a pop-up appears asking “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?” This is UAC in action. The task will only proceed after you click Yes or enter an administrator password, which helps stop malware or accidental actions from gaining full control of the system.
