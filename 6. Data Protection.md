Process to safeguarding important information from corruption, compromise, or loss.
### Data Classification
Category based on the organization's value and the sensitivity of the information if it were to be disclosed.
#### Sensitive Data:
- Any information that can result in a loss of advantage to a company if accessed by an unauthorized person.
- Basically, this is the data that we need to protect.

Anything that is sensitive, we want to make sure that there is protection around it, but we can't protect everything equally, and that's why we have to classify data into several different categories:

```
overclassifying data leads to protecting all data at a high level,so organizations need to be careful to establish proper policies to identify how data should be classified
```

There are two different classification schemes that are normally used by organizations:
Commercial Business and Governmental Classification
Commercial Business:
1. Public Data:
   Information that is publicly available and poses no risk to the company if released. Often shared openly in the public domain (e.g., company website, press releases).
   Example: Company’s marketing materials, press releases.
   
2. Sensitive Data:
   Information that, if released, has minimal impact but could still affect the organization’s reputation or finances (e.g., financial data, internal reports).
   Example: Non-public financial data or internal performance reviews.
   
3. Private Data:
   Data that should remain within the organization and is specific to individuals or internal processes. It could include employee records or internal communication.
   Example: Employee names, salaries, or HR documents.
   
4. Confidential Data:
   Sensitive business data, such as trade secrets, intellectual property, or proprietary source code, that could cause significant damage to the organization if disclosed.
   Example: Business plans, software source code, or customer databases.
   
5. Critical Data:
   Highly valuable or essential information that is crucial to the operation of the business. Its exposure could lead to severe business disruption or harm.
   Example: Financial records, customer data, operational system's data.

Governmental Classification:
1. Unclassified:
   Data that is not restricted and can be freely released to the public or under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Example: Public information about government programs or policies.
2. Sensitive but Unclassified:
   Data that isn't classified but could cause harm or discomfort if released. It doesn't affect national security, but might affect individuals or organizations.
   Example: Personal data, financial records, or internal correspondence that could cause embarrassment or harm to private entities.
3. Confidential:
   Data that, if disclosed without authorization, could seriously affect the government, organizations, or individuals, but not necessarily national security.
   Example: Internal government reports or contracts that, if leaked, could affect operations or relationships but won't compromise national security.
4. Secret:
   Data that could cause serious damage to national security if disclosed. This type of information is critical to government operations.
   Example: Military plans, intelligence data, or critical infrastructure details that, if revealed, could damage national defense.
5. Top Secret:
   The highest level of classified data. Its disclosure would cause grave damage to national security.
   Example: Information related to national defense strategies, intelligence operations, or diplomatic negotiations that, if leaked, would significantly harm national interests.
### Data Lifecycle
→Collect
→Retain
→Dispose

- the data lifecycle should be defined in policies.
- these policies should follow local, state or government laws and regulations for data retention time requirements.
### Data Ownership
Process of identifying the person responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy of the information assets.
1. Data Owner
2. Data Controller
3. Data Processor
4. Data Custodian
5. Data Steward
6. Data Privacy Officer

Explanations:
1. Data Owner:
   A senior executive responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets. They determine how the data is classified, labeled, and protected.
   Example: A CISO or CIO who ensures that sensitive data is properly controlled and protected.
   
2. Data Controller:
   The entity responsible for determining the purpose and method of data collection, storage, and usage, ensuring that all processes comply with laws and regulations.
   Example: A company that collects customer data and decides how that data will be used for marketing purposes, ensuring compliance with data protection laws like GDPR.
   
3. Data Processor:
   An individual or organization hired by the data controller to handle tasks like data collection, storage, or analysis. They do not make decisions about the data but process it on behalf of the data controller.
   Example: A cloud service provider who stores customer data for a company or a marketing agency analyzing customer behavior data.
   
4. Data Steward:
   Focuses on maintaining the quality and integrity of data and its metadata. They work with the data owner to ensure compliance with data management policies.
   Example: A person who ensures that customer data is accurate, up-to-date, and properly categorized in accordance with the organization’s data policies.
   
5. Data Custodian:
   Manages the systems where data is stored and ensures proper access controls, encryption, backups, and security measures, following the guidelines set by the data owner.
   Example: A system administrator responsible for securing servers and databases where sensitive customer data is stored.
   
6. Privacy Officer:
   Oversees the management and protection of privacy-related data (e.g., PII, SPI, PHI), ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
   Example: A Privacy Officer ensures that personal data is handled in compliance with data protection laws, performing audits and addressing privacy risks.

```
the data owner should be a business unit leader or department head who is responsible for the creation, management, and protection of data, based on their deep understanding of its content and significance to the company. This role is typically assigned to those who directly use or generate the data, rather than IT personnel, who are primarily focused on technical management and security controls. For example, in a **software development company, the Software Design or Engineering Department** would be the data owner for code, design documents, and development plans because they are most familiar with the data’s value, risks, and business impact. IT teams play a crucial role in supporting data owners by implementing technical safeguards such as encryption, access control, and backups, but the decision-making authority and responsibility for data classification and protection lie with the department that understands the data's context and purpose. This ensures that data is appropriately managed and secured according to its business relevance.
```
### Data States
Each state represent a different phase of data lifecycle and requires a specific security measures to protect against potential threats:
1. Data at Rest
2. Data in Transit
3. Data in Use

Explanations:
1. Data at Rest:
   Refers to any data stored in databases, file systems, or storage systems, data at rest is a prime target for threat actors.
   
   To save "Data at Rest", we're using encryption:
   i. Full Disk Encryption: encrypts the entire disk, ensuring all data on the device is automatically encrypted, protecting the data even if the device is lost or stolen.
   ii. Partition Encryption: encrypts a specific partition or section of the disk, ensuring only data within that partition is encrypted while leaving other partitions unprotected.
   iii. File Encryption: encrypts individual files or folders, ensuring that specific data is protected, even if the rest of the system is not encrypted.
   iv. Volume Encryption: encrypts an entire volume (a logical storage unit), such as a hard drive or USB drive, ensuring that all data within the volume is secure.
   v. Database Encryption: protects the entire database or specific sensitive fields within a database, ensuring that stored data is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access.
   vi. Record Encryption: encrypts individual records or rows of data within a database, protecting sensitive information like customer details or financial data at the record level.
   
2. Data in Transit:
   Refers to data actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network.
   
   To save "Data in Transit":
   i. SSL/TLS: SSL/TLS encrypts data between a web server and client, ensuring secure communication over the internet. It protects sensitive information, like login credentials, during transit.
   ii. VPN: a VPN encrypts internet traffic between a device and a remote server, safeguarding data on public networks. It ensures privacy and security by creating a secure tunnel for data transmission.
   iii. IPSec: IPSec encrypts and authenticates data at the IP layer, securing internet communications. It is commonly used for site-to-site and remote access VPNs to protect data in transit. 
   
3. Data in Use:
   Refers to data in the process of being created, retrieved, updated, or deleted.
   
   To save "Data in Use":
   i. Application Level Security
   ii. Access Control
   iii. Inter Software Guards
### Data Type
1. Regulated Data:
   Data that is subject to specific legal or regulatory requirements, such as healthcare data under HIPAA or financial data under GDPR. Failure to protect regulated data can result in legal penalties.
   
2. Trade Secrets:
   Confidential business information that provides a competitive advantage, like formulas, practices, or processes. It's protected to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure.
   
3. PII/PHI:
   PII refers to any data that can identify an individual (e.g., name, address). PHI refers to health information that can identify an individual, subject to strict protection under laws like HIPAA.
   
4. Intellectual Property:
   Legal rights to creations of the mind, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. It’s protected to ensure ownership and prevent unauthorized use.
   
5. Legal Information:
   Documents or data related to legal proceedings, contracts, or obligations, which need to be preserved and protected to maintain legal integrity and avoid liability.
   
6. Financial Information:
   Data related to financial activities, such as transactions, account numbers, and tax records. It is crucial to protect this data to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with financial regulations.
   
7. Human-Readable vs. Non-Human Readable Data:
   Human-readable data is information that can be easily understood by humans (e.g., text, images). Non-human-readable data refers to encrypted or encoded data that is not directly understandable without decryption or proper tools (e.g., encrypted files, binary code).
### Data Sovereignty
- Refers to the concept that digital information is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located.
- Data Sovereignty is the principle that information is subject to the laws of the nation where it is collected or processed.
- The geographical location of data storage and processing can significantly impact business.
### Securing Data
1. Geographic Restriction (Geofencing):
   Geofencing involves setting boundaries around a physical location to control access to data based on the user's geographic location. Access can be restricted or allowed depending on where the user is.
   Example: A company restricts access to sensitive data to employees only when they are within a specific geographic region, like the office premises.
   
2. Encryption:
   Encryption converts data into a coded format that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. It protects data during storage and transmission.
   Example: Encrypting emails or files ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains unreadable without the decryption key.

3. Hashing:
   Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash value, that is unique to the input data. It’s primarily used for data verification, not for recovery.
   Example: Passwords are often hashed and stored so that even if data is leaked, the actual passwords remain secure.

4. Masking:
   Masking hides parts of sensitive data by replacing it with non-sensitive characters, making it unreadable to unauthorized users while keeping the format intact.
   Example: Masking credit card numbers by showing only the last four digits (e.g., 1234) when displayed.

5. Tokenization:
   Tokenization replaces sensitive data with unique identifiers (tokens) that are meaningless without access to a secure tokenization system, keeping the original data secure.
   Example: Replacing a real credit card number with a token that is used in transactions but has no value outside the tokenization system.

6. Obfuscation:
   Obfuscation involves altering data to make it difficult to understand, while still retaining its functionality. It's often used in source code to prevent reverse engineering.
   Example: Obfuscating software code to make it harder for attackers to read or understand the program’s logic.

7. Segmentation:
   Segmentation divides a network or data into smaller, isolated sections to reduce the impact of a breach and improve security management.
   Example: Separating financial data and employee information into different network segments, so that access to one does not give access to the other.

8. Permission Restrictions:
   Permission restrictions limit access to data based on user roles or privileges, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or modify sensitive data.
   Example: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) where only HR personnel can access employee payroll information.
### Data Loss Protection (DLP)
Set up to monitor the data of a system while it's in use, in transit , or at rest in order to detect any attempts to steal the data.

Types of DLP:
1. Endpoint DLP System:
   A piece of software that's installed on a workstation or a laptop, and it's going to monitor the data that's in use on that computer.
   
2. Network DLP System:
   A piece of software or hardware that's a solution placed at the perimeter of the network to detect data in transit.
   
3. Storage DLP:
   A software that is installed on a server in the data center and inspects the data while it's at rest on the server.
   
4. Cloud-based DLP System:
   Usually offered as software-as-a-service, and it's part of the cloud service and storage needs.
