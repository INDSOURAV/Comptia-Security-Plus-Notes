##### Alerting
Alerting refers to the process of notifying relevant personnel when a potential security incident occurs.
Alert can be generated by various security tools, including our intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, security information event management system and antivirus software.
Alert can be categorized into four different types:
- True Positive (TP): A threat is present, and the system correctly detects it.
- False Positive (FP): No threat exists, but the system incorrectly flags it as malicious.
- True Negative (TN): No threat exists, and the system correctly identifies it as safe.
- False Negative (FN): A real threat is present, but the system fails to detect it.
##### Monitoring
This is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security incidents before they can cause significant damage to our systems or networks.
### Monitoring Resources
System monitoring involves observing the performance of a computer system, including its system resources like CPU utilization, resource consumption, memory consumption, disk usage, and network performance in order to help us identify any potential issues that could affect the system's performance or stability.

Baseline:
Established performance metrics and data points for standards behavior of a system, network, or application, baseline allow detection of deviations and potential issues, enabling proactive troubleshooting and maintenance.
##### Application Monitoring
Focus on managing and monitoring the performance and availability of your software applications, by tracking errors, bottlenecks, and other potential issue that could affect an application's performance or user experience.
##### Infrastructure Monitoring
Involves observing the performance and availability of an organization's physical and virtual infrastructure, including servers, networks, virtual machines, containers, cloud services and other hardware.
### Alerting and Monitoring Activities
##### Log Aggregation
This involves collecting logs from multiple sources—such as servers, firewalls, endpoints, and applications—into a centralized platform (like SIEM) to enable easier correlation, analysis, and threat detection.
##### Alerting
Once suspicious or abnormal activity is detected, the system generates alerts to notify security teams so they can quickly investigate and take action before damage occurs.
##### Scanning
Scanning evaluates systems for weaknesses: vulnerability scans identify exploitable flaws, configuration scans detect misconfigurations, and code scans check software for insecure coding practices.
##### Reporting
This provides detailed summaries of findings, alerts, trends, and overall security posture, helping teams understand risks, track performance, and support compliance requirements.
##### Archiving
Long-term storage of logs, alerts, and reports ensures historical evidence is available for investigations, audits, forensic analysis, and compliance.
##### Alert Response and Remediation / Validation
Security teams investigate alerts, confirm whether they’re true or false positives, and take corrective actions such as blocking malicious activity, patching vulnerabilities, or isolating affected systems.
##### Alert tuning
A process of refining and optimizing security alerts so that monitoring systems generate fewer false positives and focus only on meaningful, actionable events. It involves adjusting detection rules, thresholds, logic, and filtering out known safe behaviors, ensuring that security teams receive accurate alerts that truly indicate suspicious or malicious activity. This improves efficiency, reduces alert fatigue, and strengthens overall incident response.
### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Internet protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior, managed devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, printer, servers and end user client devices.

```
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used to monitor, manage, and gather information from network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and printers. It allows administrators to collect performance data, modify configurations, and receive alerts about important events on managed devices.
```

SNMP works by using Operations:
1. SNMP GET:
   The GET operation is used by an SNMP manager (like a monitoring server) to request specific information from a network device (SNMP agent).
   Example: Manager requests CPU usage or interface status.
2. SNMP SET:
   The SET operation allows an SNMP manager to modify or update a configuration on the device.
   Example: Manager changes device configurations such as enabling/disabling an interface.
3. SNMP TRAP:
   A TRAP is an unsolicited alert sent by the SNMP agent to the manager when important events occur.
   Example: Device sends a trap if a link goes down or temperature exceeds safe levels.

SNMP TRAP messages, the data sent from a device to the management system can be encoded in two main formats:
1. Granular:
   Granular encoding provides highly structured, precise data where each field in the trap corresponds to a specific attribute defined in the Management Information Base (MIB).
   Each piece of information is represented using a Unique Object Identifier (OID).
2. Verbose Encoding:
   Verbose encoding includes more descriptive, human-readable information inside the trap, often combining details into a single message. This format is easier for administrators to interpret but less structured compared to granular encoding.
##### Management Information Base (MIB)
The MIB is a hierarchical database that defines all the manageable objects on a network device. Every OID (Object Identifier) in a trap or SNMP query corresponds to an entry in the MIB, which describes what the data means and how it should be interpreted.

SNMP traps store data in a simple key-value pair structure known as a variable binding.

SNMP v1 and v2 were the earlier versions of the protocol designed mainly for device monitoring and management, using simple operations like GET, SET, and TRAP. Both rely on plaintext community strings for authentication, which provides very weak security.

SNMP v3 was introduced to solve these security gaps by providing authentication, integrity, and confidentiality through encryption and message validation. It also includes group-based access control, allowing administrators to define which users or groups can access specific data or perform certain operations. This makes SNMPv3 the most secure and recommended version for modern network environments.
### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Solution that provides real-time or near-real-time analysis of security alerts that are generated by network hardware and application.

- Agent-based SIEM uses lightweight software agents installed directly on endpoints (servers, workstations, applications) to collect logs, monitor activity in real time, and forward enriched data to the SIEM. Because agents run locally, they can capture deeper system-level details, work even during network outages, support real-time alerting, and enforce local controls such as file integrity monitoring.

- Agentless SIEM collects logs remotely without installing anything on the endpoint, typically using protocols like Syslog, WMI, SNMP, or API integrations. It’s easier to deploy and maintain but depends on network connectivity, provides less granular data, and may miss certain system-level events that agents can capture.

To effectively deploy a SIEM, you have to consider a lot of different things:
- Log all relevant event and filter irrelevant data
- Establish and document scope of events
- Develop use cases to define a threat
- Plan incident response for a threat or event
- Establish a ticketing system to track events
- Schedule regular threat hunting
- Provide auditors and analysis an evidence trail
### Data from Security Tools
1. Antivirus Software:
   Antivirus software generates data related to malware detection, file scanning results, suspicious behavior, quarantine actions, and signature updates. These logs help identify infected files, blocked threats, and attempted intrusions on endpoints.
   
2. Data Loss Prevention:
   DLP tools monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive data. They produce logs on policy violations, blocked file transfers, suspicious email attachments, and attempts to exfiltrate confidential information.
   
3. Network Intrusion Detection:
   A NIDS monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns, attack signatures, or anomalies. It produces alerts on potential intrusions like port scans, brute-force attempts, malware communication, and unusual traffic behavior.
   
4. Network Intrusion Prevention:
   NIPS performs real-time traffic inspection and automatically blocks malicious or unwanted activity. Its logs include prevented attacks, dropped packets, applied signatures/policies, and intrusion attempts stopped before reaching the host.
   
5. Firewalls:
   Firewalls log allowed and blocked traffic based on predefined security rules. Data includes source and destination IPs, ports, protocols, denied connection attempts, unusual traffic spikes, and policy violations.
   
6. Vulnerability Scanners:
   Vulnerability scanners produce reports identifying outdated software, missing patches, misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities. Their data helps prioritize remediation by listing severity levels, affected assets, and exploitability details.
### Security Content Automation and Protocol (SCAP)
Open standard that automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance for system in an organization.

Security Content Automation and Protocol is designed by NIST to provide organizations with a standardized approach to maintaining the security of their systems and includes a number of components that are used together to automate security tasks. Including vulnerability scanning, configuration checking, and software inventory.
##### SCAP Language Components
1. OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language):
   OVAL is a standardized language used to describe system vulnerabilities, configurations, and compliance states. It defines how to check a system for specific conditions - such as missing patches or insecure settings - so tools can perform consistent and automated assessments.
2. XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format):
   XCCDF is a structured format for writing security checklists, benchmarks, and configuration guidelines. It defines rules, scoring, and recommended settings, allowing organizations to enforce consistent security baselines across systems.
3. ARF (Asset Reporting Format):
   ARF is a standardized reporting format that collects and stores the results of security scans or system assessments. It consolidates data from tools like OVAL and XCCDF, making it easier to interpret findings, track compliance, and generate reports.
##### Asset and vulnerability enumeration standards
1. CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration):
   CCE provides unique identifiers for security configuration issues - for example, insecure settings, weak policies, or misconfigurations. It helps organizations standardize and track configuration problems across different tools and systems.
2. CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):
   CPE is a standardized naming system used to uniquely identify hardware, operating systems, and applications. Security tools use CPE names to match vulnerabilities or configuration checks to the correct software or device.
3. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):
   CVE is a globally recognized list that assigns unique, standardized IDs to publicly known security vulnerabilities. Each CVE entry describes a specific flaw so that researchers, vendors, and security tools can reference the same vulnerability consistently.
##### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
CVSS is a standardized framework used to measure the severity of security vulnerabilities. It assigns a numerical score ranging from 0 to 10, based on how easily the vulnerability can be exploited and the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CVSS helps organizations prioritize which vulnerabilities to fix first by categorizing them as Low, Medium, High, or Critical severity.
##### Benchmark 
A benchmark (in cybersecurity) is a standardized security guideline or baseline configuration that defines how systems, applications, or devices should be securely configured. Benchmarks provide recommended settings such as password policies, port configurations, logging requirements, and service restrictions - to harden systems and reduce security risks.
### NetFlow and Flow Analysis
##### Full Packet Capture (FPC)
Captures the entire packet, including the header and the payload for all traffic entering and leaving a network.
##### Flow Analysis
Relies on a flow collector, which records metadata and statistics rather than recording each frame that passes through the network, flow analysis does not provide the actual content.
Flow analysis rapidly generates visualizations to map network connections, traffic types, and session volumes.
##### Net Flow
A Cisco-developed means of reporting network flow info to a structured database.
IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX): Defines traffic flows based on shared packet characteristics.

- Zeek:
  Formerly Bro is a powerful network traffic analysis and monitoring tool used for security investigations. Instead of just capturing packets, Zeek interprets network traffic at a higher level and generates detailed logs about protocols, connections, DNS queries, HTTP activity, and suspicious behaviors. It's widely used in SOCs for threat detection, incident response, and network forensics.
- MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher):
  MRTG is a network monitoring tool that collects data—usually via SNMP—from routers, switches, and other devices, then visualizes bandwidth usage in graphs. It helps administrators track network load, detect traffic spikes, and plan capacity. MRTG mainly focuses on performance monitoring, not security analysis.
### Single Pane of Glass
Single Pane of Glass refers to a unified dashboard or interface that provides a centralized, comprehensive view of an organization’s systems, security events, logs, and performance metrics. Instead of switching between multiple tools, administrators can monitor, analyze, and manage everything from one place.

This improves visibility, reduces complexity, speeds up troubleshooting, and enhances decision-making in security and IT operations.
##### Benefits of Single Pane of Glass
- A single pane of glass simplifies security management by providing a unified view for monitoring and tracking all activities.
- Security teams can continuously monitor the environment for suspicious activity, unusual traffic, or threat alerts from one central dashboard.
- It supports secure software development by allowing teams to verify that all security requirements are met throughout the development lifecycle.
- A single pane of glass improves the overall efficiency of the Security Operations Center (SOC) by reducing tool switching and centralizing analysis.
- It enhances collaboration and communication among security teams by ensuring everyone works from the same consolidated information source.
- It provides a complete and unified view of multi-cloud environments, helping security teams manage and secure distributed cloud resources effectively.
##### Steps to implement a Single Page of Glass
1. Defining the requirements
2. Identifying and integrating data sources
