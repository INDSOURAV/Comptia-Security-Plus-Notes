Systematic and ongoing process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in computer system, in networks and software applications to maintain a secure and resilient cybersecurity posture.
This process includes vulnerability scanning, assessment, remediation, and monitoring.
### Identifying Vulnerabilities
Systematic practice of spotting and categorizing weaknesses in a system, network, or application that could potentially be exploited.
Methods used to identify vulnerabilities:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Application security techniques
- Penetration testing
- Security and process auditing
##### Vulnerability Scanning
Automated method of probing networks, systems, and application to discover potential vulnerabilities (can identity known vulnerabilities).
Nessus and openVAS are example of automated vulnerability scanning tool.
##### Application Security
Used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during its lifecycle, at its core application security techniques are going to be used to ensure that any custom software that our organization develops is going to be free of vulnerabilities with-in its code base.
 - Static analysis:
   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is used to analyze an application’s source code without running or executing the program. Because the application is not executed, this is considered a static analysis technique. SAST helps identify potential vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices within the codebase at an early stage of development. This analysis can be performed either through a manual code review, where each line of source code is examined for security flaws, or by using automated tools that scan the source code or compiled binaries to detect weaknesses introduced by poor or insecure development practices.
   
 - Dynamic analysis:
   Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, evaluates an application while it is running to determine whether vulnerabilities exist within the application. Dynamic analysis tools such as OWASP ZAP or the Peach fuzzing tool interact with the application in real time by emulating potential attack vectors. These tools observe how the application responds to malicious or unexpected inputs and then determine whether the application is vulnerable to specific types of attacks.
   
 - Package monitoring:
   Package monitoring ensures that the libraries and components an application depends on are secure and kept up to date. There are many tools available for this purpose, such as Snyk and Dependabot, which continuously scan application dependencies and alert developers to any known vulnerabilities that may exist within those dependencies. This allows vulnerabilities to be identified and mitigated before an attacker can discover and exploit them.
##### Penetration Testing
Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture.
##### System and Process Audits
Process that involves conducting a comprehensive review of the information system, security policies, and procedures.

When it comes to identifying vulnerabilities, you should usually use a four-step process:
- Planning:
  Planning entails defining policies, procedures, and mechanisms to systematically track and evaluate vulnerabilities within a system. Effective planning also includes deciding how vulnerabilities will be tested, validated, and how fixes will be deployed across systems in a controlled and timely manner.
- Testing:
  During the second step, testing is conducted. Testing involves evaluating patches and updates in a controlled environment before performing a full deployment across the enterprise network. This process ensures that the solutions used to mitigate vulnerabilities do not introduce new vulnerabilities, issues, or operational problems within the systems.
- Implementing:
  Implementation involves deploying the approved patches across the required devices and applications. Whether the environment is a small network with only a few systems or a large enterprise network with thousands of endpoints, implementing these updates is a critical step in mitigating the vulnerabilities identified during the scanning and auditing process.
- Auditing:
  Auditing ensures that the security practices and configuration changes required to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities have been implemented effectively. It also allows verification that no new issues have been introduced after the implementation phase has been completed.
### Threat Intelligence Feeds
Continual process used to understand the threats faced by an organization.
##### Threat intelligence feed
A threat intelligence feed provides a continuous stream of data related to potential or active threats that may impact an organization’s security. This data is collected, analyzed, and shared by security researchers, organizations, and automated tools, and it delivers real-time or near-real-time information such as new malware signatures, indicators of compromise, malicious IP addresses, URLs, and other threat-related details. Organizations can use multiple types of threat intelligence feeds to stay up to date with the latest security threats and proactively strengthen their security posture. These feeds may originate from various sources, including open-source intelligence, proprietary or third-party providers, information-sharing organizations, and the dark web.
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):
  Intelligence that is collected from publicly available sources including reports, forums, news articles, blogs, and social posts.
  Example: AlienVault open threat exchange
- Proprietary or Third-Party Feeds:
  Threat intelligence feeds that are provided by commercial vendors, usually under a subscription service type of business model.
  Example: FireEye, McAfee, Symantic
- Information Sharing Organization:
  There are information sharing organizations and alliances that have been formed to share Threat Intelligence among their members.
- Dark Web:
  Part of the internet that is intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard web browsers.
  Now, security researchers and organizations will sometimes explore the dark web forums and marketplaces to try and uncover the information about new hacking techniques and tools, stolen data and emerging threats that are existing there on the dark web.

Threat intelligence feeds are an essential tool in a cybersecurity professional's toolkit.
### Responsible Disclosure Programs
Responsible disclosure is an ethical practice in which a security researcher reports information about a vulnerability in software, hardware, or an online service in a confidential manner to the relevant stakeholders, such as the software developers or the organization that created the product or service. The goal of responsible disclosure is to give the affected party sufficient time to address and remediate the vulnerability before it is publicly disclosed. This process helps ensure that the vulnerability remains confidential until a fix or patch has been developed and deployed.
##### Bug Bounty
Bug bounty programs encourage cybersecurity researchers to find and responsibly report vulnerabilities. These programs help improve an organization’s security, foster collaboration with the security community, and provide a cost-effective way to identify weaknesses. However, organizations must carefully define considerations such as the scope of the program, rules of engagement, and reward structure to ensure the program is effective and well managed.
### Analyzing Vulnerabilities
- Confirmation:
  Confirmation involves verifying that a detected vulnerability is genuine and applicable to the organization’s environment. This step ensures that the issue is not a false positive by checking system configurations, software versions, and exposure. Accurate confirmation prevents unnecessary remediation efforts and focuses resources on real risks.
  
- Classification:
  Classification is the process of categorizing a vulnerability based on its type, cause, or technical nature. Vulnerabilities may be classified as application flaws, misconfigurations, missing patches, or access control weaknesses. Proper classification helps teams understand the root cause and apply the correct remediation strategy.
  
- Prioritization:
  Prioritization determines the order in which vulnerabilities should be addressed based on their risk level. Factors such as severity, exploitability, asset criticality, and internet exposure are considered. This ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities with the highest potential impact are resolved first.
  
- Organizational Impact:
  Organizational impact evaluates how a vulnerability could affect business operations if exploited. This includes potential financial loss, data breaches, regulatory penalties, operational downtime, and reputational damage. Understanding business impact helps align technical risk with business priorities.
  
- Exposure Factor:
  Exposure factor represents the estimated percentage of an asset’s value that could be lost due to a successful exploitation of a vulnerability. It is commonly used in quantitative risk assessments to calculate potential financial loss. A higher exposure factor indicates greater potential damage to the organization.
  
- Risk Tolerance:
  Risk tolerance defines the level of risk an organization is willing to accept without taking additional action. It guides decision-making on whether to remediate, mitigate, transfer, or accept a vulnerability-related risk. Risk tolerance is influenced by business objectives, regulatory requirements, and overall security posture.
### Vulnerability Response and Remediation
Vulnerability response and remediation refers to the strategies and actions taken to identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities in a system or network by aiming to mitigate risks associated with those known vulnerabilities so that you can strengthen your organization's security posture.

When a vulnerability is identified within an organization, it's imperative to respond effectively and efficiently to mitigate or completely neutralize that threat.
The process of vulnerability response and remediation is going to encompass a range of options including patching, purchasing cybersecurity insurance policies, network segmentation, implementing compensating controls, and granting exceptions and exemptions.
##### Patching
Patching refers to the process of applying updates to a software system or application in order to fix security vulnerabilities and improve performance. These patches are usually released by software vendors to address known flaws that could be exploited by threat actors. Regular patching helps organizations maintain system stability, enhance security, and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
##### Purchasing Cybersecurity Insurance Policies
Purchasing a cybersecurity insurance policy is a risk management strategy in which an organization obtains an insurance policy designed to mitigate financial losses resulting from cyber incidents such as data breaches, network outages, and business interruptions. This type of insurance helps organizations recover from unexpected cyber events by covering costs related to investigation, legal actions, recovery, and operational downtime.
##### Network Segmentation
Network segmentation involves dividing a computer network into smaller segments to improve performance and enhance security by isolating different parts of the network from one another. This approach helps limit the spread of threats, so if one segment becomes compromised, the attack cannot easily propagate to other areas of the organization’s network.
##### Implementing Compensating Controls
Compensating controls are alternative security measures that are implemented when a standard security control cannot be applied effectively to a system. These controls are designed to provide an equivalent level of protection while mitigating security risks. For example, an organization may decide to implement multifactor authentication (MFA) on all systems as a best practice for securing user accounts. However, some legacy servers may not support MFA due to outdated software. Until these systems can be upgraded or replaced, the organization can apply compensating controls such as strong password policies, account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts, and regular security awareness training. These measures help reduce security risks and compensate for the absence of MFA on legacy systems.
##### Granting Exception and Exemptions
Granting exemptions and exceptions is a risk management approach in which an organization allows certain systems to operate without following specific security controls due to business or technical limitations. For example, a research department may rely on an older computer system to test historical data, but this system may not support updated security software required on the organization’s network. In such cases, the information security officer may grant an exemption, so the system is not required to receive future updates. To reduce the associated risk, the system can be physically and logically isolated from the rest of the network, ensuring that potential security threats are properly mitigated.
### Validating Vulnerability Remediation
1. Rescanning:
   Rescanning involves performing another vulnerability scan after remediation efforts have been completed to verify that the identified vulnerabilities have been successfully eliminated. This process helps confirm that patches, configuration changes, or security updates were applied correctly. In some cases, rescanning may also reveal new vulnerabilities that were previously undetected, allowing organizations to address them proactively.
2. Auditing:
   Auditing focuses on reviewing systems and configurations to ensure they comply with security policies and best practices. This includes checking for misconfigurations, validating access controls, and confirming that patches have been properly installed. Patch auditing also helps verify that systems are running the correct software versions and that no critical updates have been missed.
3. Verification:
   Verification involves confirming remediation effectiveness through practical testing and feedback mechanisms. This may include penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks, user verification to ensure systems function as intended, and feedback loops to report any remaining security issues. Verification ensures that security controls are not only in place but are also working effectively in real operational environments.
### Vulnerability Reporting
Vulnerability reporting is the process of documenting and communicating details about security weaknesses that were identified in systems or software to the individuals or organizations that are responsible for addressing the issues to be able to ensure that these vulnerabilities are managed discreetly and effectively to prevent exploitation.
##### Internal Reporting
Internal reporting serves as the first line of defense in the vulnerability management reporting involves the identification, documenting, and communication of your organization's vulnerabilities within the organizational structure of your organization.
##### External Reporting
Involves discussions with the vendors, partners, customers, or the public at large, depending on the specific vulnerability involved but protect sensitive systems and data from disclosure.
##### Responsible Disclosure Reporting
Art of disclosing vulnerabilities ethically and judiciously to the affected stakeholders before making the announcement to the public at large.

Vulnerability reports are non-negotiable for confidentiality
