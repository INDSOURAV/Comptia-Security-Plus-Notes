#### Audit
Systematic evaluation of an organization's information systems, application and security controls, to ensure their efficiency and effectiveness.
Audit can be Internal or External.
- Internal Audit Example:
  An example of an internal audit would be an organization internal audit team. Conducting a review of a company's data protection policy, they will check whether the policies are up-to-date, comprehensive, and in line with the latest regulatory requirements. They also verify if these policies are being followed correctly by all employees.
  
- External Audit Example:
  An example of an external audit would be a third-party auditor being hired to evaluate an e-commerce company's compliance with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The auditor checks the company's network security, data encryption method and access control mechanism to ensure that credit card information is being handled securely.

Audit is crucial for identifying gaps in security policies, procedure and controls.
#### Assessment
Performing a detailed analysis of an organization's security system to identify vulnerabilities and risks.

The goal of assessment is to understand the potential risk and threats to an organization's information system and proper mitigation strategies to address these vulnerabilities.
Assessment can be categorized into "Risk Assessment", "Vulnerability Assessment" and "Threat Assessment".
### Internal Audits and Assessment
Systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance, and integrity of information systems and procedure, the focus area here:
 - Data protection
 - Network security
 - Access controls
 - Incident response

Conducted by organization's own audit team only.
Example:
An internal audit might involve a review of the organization's password policy. The audit team would check whether the policy aligns with best practices, such as requiring complex password and regular password changes, and whether this policy is being followed correctly by all employees.

Concepts related to Audit:
1. Compliance
2. Audit Committee

Explanations:
1. Compliance:
   Compliance refers to the process of ensuring that an organization's information system, and security practice adhere to established standards, regulations, and laws. Compliance is crucial for protecting sensitive data, avoiding legal penalties, and maintaining trust with customers and stakeholders. Compliance can involve a variety of activities, including implementing specific security controls, maintaining certain policies and procedures, and regularly auditing and assessing the organization's security posture.

2. Audit Committee:
   An audit committee is a group of individuals, typically members of the company's board of directors, who oversees the organization's audit and compliance activities. The audit committee's responsibilities often include reviewing the organization's financial reporting processes and internal control, overseeing the performance of internal and external audits, ensuring the organization is in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and lastly reviewing and addressing any issues raised by auditors.
#### Internal Assessment
An in-depth analysis to identify and assist potential risk and vulnerability in an organization's information system. 
These assessments are often performed before implementing new systems or making significant changes to existing ones. 

Most internal assessments are conducted as a self-assessment.
##### Self-assessment:
Internal review conducted by an organization to gauge its adherence to particular standards or regulations. 
Example:
If a software company is planning to launch a new web application before the launch, the company security team conducted an internal assessment to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities. 

A large organization may have a dedicated internal assessment team that travels throughout the enterprise to evaluate the network. 

Regardless of whether a self-assessment or an assigned internal assessment is being conducted, the assessor will follow the same basic steps:
Let's walk through an example of your organization venting to launch a new web application into their production environment. 
1. Conducting a threat modeling exercise where potential threats are identifies:
   First, the assessment begins with a threat modeling exercise, where the team identifies potential threats to your application, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or a denial-of-service attack. 
   
2. Assessing vulnerability by using automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques:
   Next, the team conducts a vulnerability assessment using a combination of automated scanning tool and manual testing technique. They will systematically test the application for non-vulnerabilities and any potential weaknesses in this code. 
   
3. Performing risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact of identified threats:
   Then, the team will perform the risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact of the identified threat and vulnerabilities. The team will also consider factors such as the likelihood of the threat being exploited, the potential damage that it could cause, and the cost of implementing security measures. 
   
4. Recommending mitigation strategies bases on the result:
   Based on the results of the assessment up to this point, the team will recommend mitigation strategies to address the identified risks and vulnerabilities. This might include code fixes, implementation of additional security controls, or changes to the application architecture.
### External Audit and Assessment
Systematic evaluation carried out by an external entity to assess an organization's information system, and control, the focus area here:
 - Data protection
 - Network security
 - Access controls
 - Incident response

The aim of external audit is to uncover deficiencies in policies and control to ensure alignment with diverse regulation standards. 
Example:
A finance institute might hire an external auditor to evaluate compliance with PCI DSS once per quarter or once per year. The external auditor would then review the institute's cardholder data environment and examine any security measures such as firewall, encryption method, and access control to ensure that they meet the requirements of PCI DSS standards.
#### External Assessment
We can also have external assessment conducted on Organizational Enterprise Network. An external assessment is a detailed analysis that is conducted by an independent entity or entities to identify vulnerabilities and risks in an organization's security system. 

The external assessment often involves a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's security. Vulnerabilities' external assessment can take various forms, including "Risk Assessment", "Vulnerability Assessment", and "Threat Assessment". 

Example:
A healthcare organization might engage a cybersecurity firm to conduct a vulnerability assessment of its electronic health record system to ensure that it is compliant with HIPAA regulation requirements. The external assessment firm would then use a specialized tool to scan the system for non-vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfiguration settings, and then provide a report detailing these vulnerabilities and recommendations that mitigate strategies and that the organization should implement.

##### Regulatory Compliance
Objective that organization aim to reach in adherence to applicable law, policies, and regulations. 
##### Examination
Examinations are detailed inspections of an organization's security infrastructure that are conducted externally, and they can cover a wide range of areas from network security to data protection to access control. 

In addition to this part of examination which act very much like an assessment, an examination may also include some testing of your key personnel using standardized testing, checking if their certifications are currently and up to date, and things like that.
Examinations review policies, procedures, and controls, and address weaknesses. 
##### Independent Third-party Audit
Offers validation of security practices, fostering trust with customers, stakeholders, and regulatory authorities. This is a crucial component of organization's cybersecurity strategy that is used to provide an unbiased perspective of organization's security posture that helps to identify potential weaknesses that might be overlooked in internal audit or assessment. 

GDPR and PCI DSSs mandate regular third-party independent audit as part of compliance obligation for organizations.
### Penetration Testing
Penetration testing, also known as pen-testing or ethical hacking, is the practice of simulating a cyberattack against a company's system to check for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.
Types of Penetration Testing:
1. Physical Pentesting:
   Testing an organization's security through testing locks, access control, security cameras, and other building managements.
   Example:
   A physical pen tester penetration tester might try to bypass a company's security by tailgating behind employees as they enter through a security door or access control vestibules. 
   A physical pen test aims to find weaknesses in an organization's physical security and suggest enhancements to bolster it.
   
2. Offensive Pentesting (Red Teaming):
   Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities.
   Example:
   A Red teamer trying to gain unauthorized access to a computer network by exploiting a vulnerability in a piece of software, the tester would then report this vulnerability to the company so that they can fix it before a real attacker will exploit that same vulnerability. 
   
3. Defensive Pentesting (Blue Teaming):
   Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing incident response times.
   Example:
   A defensive penetration tester might monitor a network for signs of unusual activity that could indicate an attack. If an attack is detected, the tester would then work to mitigate the damage and strengthen the system to prevent future attacks.

4. Integrated Pentesting (Purple Teaming):
   Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test.
   Example:
   Red Team sends a phishing email with a malicious link, while the Blue Team monitors email security logs and endpoint alerts. Together, they enhance email filtering rules and improve user awareness training.
### Reconnaissance
An initial phase where critical information about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success.
Example:
Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system such as IP addresses, domain addresses, mail servers, and other potential security or detection systems the organization may have in place. This information can then be used to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be exploited by an attacker.

Types of Reconnaissance:
1. Active:
   Direct engagement with the targeted system, offering more information but with a higher detection risk.
   Example:
   An attacker might use a tool like Nmap to scan for open ports on the target system as part of an active reconnaissance technique, but the system defenders will see the port scanning occur, and this could identify where the attack is coming from based off these port scans.
   
2. Passive:
   Gathering information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data.
   Example:
   An attacker might use a tool like WHOIS to get information about the points of contact for a domain name to use as a part of their reconnaissance and planning.

Reconnaissance necessity and extent depend on the test type and environment:
1. Known Environment:
   Detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received prior to the test.
   This may include things like network diagrams, IP address, application details, operating system version and even credentials.
   The aim are to focus on known assets, understand exploitability and potential damage, resembles an insider threat scenario and evaluates vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
   
2. Partially Known Environment:
   Involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system.
   The penetration tester might know some aspects of the system such as certain IP ranges, or application endpoints, but other information is withheld.
   
3. Unknown Environment:
   Tester receive minimal to no information about the target system.
   The attacker might only be given the company's name or web domain as a starting point.
### Attestation of Findings
Process that involves the formal validation or confirmation provided by an entity that is used to assert the accuracy and authenticity of specific information.
Ensure providing a summary of the assessment findings along with evidence of its completion, letter of attestation is discussed to provide proof of a conducted penetration test.
- Software Attestation: 
  Involves validating the integrity of software by checking that it has not been tampered with or alerted maliciously.
- Hardware Attestation:
  Involves validating the integrity of hardware components.
- System Attestation:
  Involves validating the security posture of a system.

Attestation helps to:
- Strengthening trust
- Enhancing transparency
- Ensuring accountability
