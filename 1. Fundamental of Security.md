There are two key terms, when we talk about security:
1. Information Security
2. Information System Security

Explanation:
1. Information Security:
   Act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, and corruption and destruction.
2. Information System Security:
   Act of protecting the system that hold and process the critical data, such as computer, phone, server and a network device.
#### Threats and Vulnerabilities
our job as cybersecurity professionals is to prevent threats from exploiting our enterprise system's vulnerabilities.
##### Threat:
Anything that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to an information technology system.
Such as:
- natural disaster
- cyberattacks
- data integrity beaches
- disclosure of confidential information
##### Vulnerability
Any weakness in the system design or implementation
Such as:
- software bugs
- misconfigured software
- improper protected network devices
- missing security patches
- lack of physical security

⇾ Few vulnerabilities are with-in our control, for us to prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited by mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting the risk involved with those vulnerabilities.
⇾ intersection of threat and vulnerability is where the risk to enterprise systems and networks lies.

```
threat + no vulnerability = no risk
no threat + vulnerability = no risk
```

→ Risk Management: finding different ways to minimize the likelihood of an outcome occurring and achieve the desired outcome.
### Confidentiality
- refers to protection of information from unauthorized access and disclosure
- ensure that private or sensitive information is not available or disclosed to an unauthorized individual, entity or process

Why confidentiality is important:
- protect personal privacy
- maintain a business advantage
- achieve regulatory compliance

In order to achieve confidentiality, we are going to use the following method:
1. Encryption
2. Access Control
3. Data Masking
4. Physical Security Measures
5. Training and Awareness

Explanation:
1. Encryption:
   Process of converting data into code(cipher text) to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Access Control:
   Ensure only authorized personnel can access certain type of data.
3. Data Masking:
   a Method that involves obscuring data with in a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorized users, while retaining the real data's authenticity and use for an authorized user.
   Example: masking credit card number - `**** **** **** 1234 
4. Physical Security Measures:
   used to ensure confidentiality for physical types of data and for digital information stored on servers and workstations.
	   - locking cabinets
	   - biometric
	   - security camera, etc.
5. Training and Awareness:
   Conducting regular training on the security awareness best practices that employees can use to protect the organization's sensitive data.
### Integrity
- Ensure information and data remain accurate and unchanged and untouched from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorized individual.
- Verifies the accuracy and trust-worthiness of data over the entire lifecycle.
- Data should be reliable and unaltered as it's processed, transferred and stored by our system and networks.

Why confidentiality is important:
- ensure data integrity
- maintain trust
- ensure system operability

In order to achieve integrity, we are going to use the following method:
1. Hashing
2. Digital Signature
3. Checksum
4. Access Control
5. Regular Audit

Explanation:
1. Hashing: 
   Creates a unique digital "fingerprint" of data; if the data changes by even one bit, the hash value changes entirely, revealing tampering.
2. Digital Signature: 
   Uses encryption to tie a hash to a specific sender, proving both that the data hasn't been altered and that it came from a legitimate source.
3. Checksum: 
   A simple mathematical value used primarily to detect accidental errors or corruption during file transfers or storage.
   Example: when downloading a large file (like a Linux installer), the website provides a "MD5" or "SHA" checksum. You run a quick command on your PC to see if your file's checksum matches. If it doesn't, your download was likely corrupted by a weak Wi-Fi signal.
4. Access Control: 
   Restricts who has "write" or "edit" permissions, ensuring only authorized users can modify sensitive information.
   Example: In a hospital, a Doctor can "write" to a patient’s medical record, but a Receptionist may only have "read" access. This prevents unauthorized staff from accidentally or maliciously changing health data.
5. Regular Audit: 
   A systematic review of logs and records to detect unauthorized changes and ensure that security policies are being followed correctly.
### Availability
- used to ensure that information, system, and resources are accessible and operational, when needed by authorized users.

Why availability is important:
- ensuring business continuity
- maintain customer trust
- upholding an organization's reputation

In order to achieve availability, we are going to use the following method:
- Redundancy:
  Duplication of critical component or function of a system with the intention of enhancing its reliability.
	- Server redundancy:
	  This involves using multiple servers to run the same applications. If one server crashes due to a hardware or software fault, a secondary server automatically takes over the workload to prevent service downtime. (Load balancing)
	- Data Redundancy:
	  This ensures that your information is stored in two or more separate places, It protects against data loss and ensures users can still access files even if a specific storage drive fails. 
	- Network Redundancy:
	  This provides multiple physical paths and devices (like routers, switches, and dual ISPs) for data to travel through. If a specific cable is cut or a network switch fails, the system automatically reroutes traffic through an alternate path to maintain internet and internal connectivity.  
	- Power Redundancy:
	  This utilizes multiple power sources, such as UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) batteries and backup generators, to keep hardware running during an outage. Servers often have dual power supplies connected to different electrical circuits so that the loss of one power grid doesn't shut the machine down.
### Non-Repudiation:
- Focused on providing undeniable proof in digital transaction.
- A security measure that ensures an individual or entity involved in a communication or transaction can't deny their participation or the authenticity of their actions.

Why non-repudiation is important:
- confirming the authenticity of transaction
- ensuring integrity
- providing accountability

In order to achieve non-repudiation, we are going to use the following method:
- Non-Repudiation achieved with the help of "Digital Signature"
  A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital data.  
  It is created using the sender’s private key and verified using the public key.  They are commonly used in secure emails, software distribution, and online transactions.
### Authentication
- Security measure that ensure individual or entities are who they claim to be during a communication or transaction.

Why Authentication is important:
- prevent unauthorized access
- protect user data and privacy
- ensure resources validity

Types of Authentication:
1. Something you know: 
   Information only the user knows, such as: password, pin, passphrase and security questions
2. Something you have:
   A physical or digital item the user owns, such as: OTP sent to mobile/email, smart card, hardware token, authentication app
3. Something you are:
   Biometric characteristics, such as: fingerprint, face recognition, iris scan, voice recognition
4. Something you do:
   Patterns in how a user behaves, such as: typing speed, mouse movement patterns
5. Somewhere you are: Based on the user’s physical or network location, such as: GPS
   location, IP address, logging in only from office network, country-based access restrictions
### Authorization
- Permission and privileges granted to users or entities after they have been authenticated.
- Authorization ensure what action, a user can perform, data can view or modify and area can access.
  Example: a hospital system allowing nurses to view patient charts, but only doctor to edit them.
- Authorization mechanism range from role based to rule based to attribute based controls to determine permission.

Why Authorization is important:
- protect sensitive data
- maintain system integrity
- create more streamlined user experiences
### Accounting
- Security measure that ensures all user activities are properly tracked and recorded.
- Accounting provides:
	- transparency
	- security
	- accountability
- Monitoring and logging every action that a user makes within a given system:
	- logging into the system
	- accessing file
	- modifying configuration settings
	- downloading or installing software
	- attempting unauthorized action on system and network

Why Accounting is important:
1. Audit Trail:
   maintain a chronological, immutable log of all system activities to ensure complete transparency and traceability.
2. Regulatory Compliance:
   provides verifiable evidence of adherence to global standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
3. Forensic Analysis:
   enables investigators to reconstruct security incident, identify root cause etc.
4. Resources Optimization:
   identifies system inefficiencies and underutilized assets through activity monitoring to improve operational performance.
5. User Accountability:
   discourages internal threats and policy violations.

In order to achieve Accountability, we are going to use the following technologies:
1. Syslog Server:
   used to aggregate logs from various networks devices and system, so that system administrator can analyze them to detect patterns or anomalies in the organization's systems.
2. Network Analyzers:
   used to capture and analyze network traffic to gain detailed insights into all the data moving within a network (example: Wireshark).
3. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):
   provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by various hardware and software infrastructure in an organization.
### Security Control Categories
Security control categories refer to the classification of measures implemented to protect an organization's information systems and data from security threats.

1. Technical Controls
2. Managerial Controls
3. Operational Controls
4. Physical Controls

Explanations
1. Technical Controls:
   the technologies, hardware and software mechanism that are implemented to manage and reduce risks. (operate within a system technology layer)
   Example: antivirus software, firewall, IDS, encryption
2. Managerial Controls: 
   also known as Administrative Control, involve the strategic planning and governance side of security. Ensure that organization security strategies align with its business goals and risk tolerances.
   Example: an organization wants to adopt a cloud storage solution, so before they make the jump into the cloud, the managerial team is going to conduct a risk assessment to understand potential vulnerabilities and assess, whether the move into the cloud will align with the company's broader risk strategy.
   Beyond risk assessment, managerial control also encompass security policies, training program and IP strategies.
3. Operational Controls:
   Procedures and measure that are designed to protect data in a day-to-day basis and are mainly governed by internal processes and human actions.
   Example: changing your password in every 90 days, backup procedures, account reviews
4. Physical Controls:
   tangible, real-world measures taken to protect assets, such as: door lock, camera etc.
### Security Control:
Security professionals implement various controls depending on the specific threats and vulnerabilities:
1. Preventative Control
2. Deterrent Control
3. Detective Control
4. Corrective Control
5. Compensating Control
6. Directive Control

Explanations:
1. Preventative Control:
   Proactive measures, implemented to thwart potential security threats or breaches, aim to fortify your system before an incident actually occurs.
   Example: firewall
2. Deterrent Control:
   Aim to discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging.
   Example: a visible login banner that warns of monitoring and prosecution.
3. Detective Controls:
   Monitor and alert organizations to malicious activities as they occur or shortly thereafter.
   Example: IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
4. Corrective Controls:
   Mitigate any potential damage and restore the system to their normal state.
   Example: Anti-virus tool
5. Compensating Controls:
   Alternative measures that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective.
   Example: You may be running a legacy system that simply can't support the latest wireless encryption WPA3, in this case you might choose to implement WPS2 and use a VPN (for better encryption support)
6. Directive Controls:
   Often rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behavior with in an organization.
   Example: Security policies and procedures - written rule on data handling, password complexity or acceptable use policy.
### De-Parameterization
De-Parameterization in cybersecurity refers to the shift away from the traditional security model that relies on a strong network boundary (the "Perimeter"), such as a firewall protecting a trusted internal network from an untrusted outside world.

```
traditional model:
assumes inside = trusted
outside = untrusted
-> working poorly with cloud, remote work and mobile device

de-parameterization:
assumes no implicit trust, even inside to network
```
### Zero-Trust
Zero Trust is a cybersecurity model in which **no user, device, or system is trusted by default**, whether inside or outside the network. Every access request must be verified, authorized, and continuously monitored. It follows the principle “Trust nothing, verify everything”.

To implement Zero Trust, organizations use two main planes: 
1. Control plane
2. Data plane

Explanations:
1. The Control Plane (The "Brain") :
   The control plane is responsible for defining, managing, and evaluating access policies and making security decisions. It controls policy-based access control in Zero Trust.
   It contains the Policy Decision Point (PDP), which includes:
    - Policy Engine (PE):
      Evaluates access requests based on identity, device posture, location, behavior, and risk. It checks security rules and policies and decides whether access should be allowed or denied.
    - Policy Administrator (PA):  
      Applies the decision made by the Policy Engine. It issues session credentials and sends instructions to enforcement systems.
   Policy-Based Access Control:
   All access decisions in the control plane are made according to predefined security policies based on user roles, responsibilities, and risk levels.

2. The Data Plane (The "Muscle") :
   The data plane is where the actual communication happens. It is the path through which application data, files, and user traffic flow after authorization.  
   Key Functions:  
	- Enforcing the decisions made by the Control Plane.  
	- Creating encrypted tunnels for secure data transmission. 
	- Monitoring and logging active session activity.  
	- Terminating connections immediately if the Control Plane revokes access.
	- The PEP allows or blocks traffic based on control plane policies.
	- It ensures that only authorized users can access resources.

```
Zero-Trust is a cybersecurity approach that assumes no user or system is trusted by default and requires continuous verification for access to organizational resources.
```
### Gap Analysis
Process of evaluating the differences between an organization's current performance and its desired performance.
Steps:
1. Define the scope of the analysis.
2. Gather data on the current state of the organization.
3. Analyze the data to identify the gap.
4. Develop a plan to provide the gap.

There are two basic type of gap analysis:
1. Technical Gap Analysis:
   This assesses the technology and security infrastructure to ensure it meets specific standards or performance requirements. It identifies missing hardware, outdated software, or weak security controls that prevent a system from operating at its intended level. The focus is on the "how" of technical delivery and system integrity.

2. Business Gap Analysis
   This evaluates operational processes and strategic goals to see if the organization is meeting its performance targets. It highlights deficiencies in workforce skills, workflow efficiency, or market positioning compared to the desired "future state." The goal is to align business resources with the overall mission and profitability.
   
Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M):
A POA&M is a remediation roadmap that documents the specific steps, resources, and timelines needed to close identified gaps. It assigns accountability to individuals and tracks progress through measurable milestones to ensure continuous improvement. In regulated industries, it serves as a formal commitment to fix security or operational weaknesses.
