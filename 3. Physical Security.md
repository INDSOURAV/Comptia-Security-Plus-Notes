Measures taken to protect tangible assets, like buildings, equipment, and people, from harm or unauthorized access.
### Fence:
Structure that enclose an area using interconnected panels or posts. Now, in terms of physical security, fences are going to serve several different purposes:
- provides a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should bot be violated by unauthorized personnel.
- establishes a physical barrier against unauthorized entry.
- delays intruders, which help provide security personnel with a longer window of time to react

So, Fences protecting our facilities against:
 - trespassing
 - theft
 - vandalism
 - unauthorized facility access

But, at the same time, this fence can be vulnerable to attack.
### Bollards
Robust, short vertical posts, made of steel or concrete, that are designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic.

So, Bollards protecting our facilities by:
- create a physical barrier that shields pedestrians, structures, and other assets from potential vehicular collisions.
- serves a secondary purpose as a clear visual reminder of where vehicle are not permitted.

But, Bollards are not invulnerable to attack.

```
- Fences are adaptable and well-suited for safeguarding large perimeters around the entire building (prevent people)
- Bollards are designed to counter vehicular threats in an area (prevent vehicle)
```
### Attacking with Brute Force
Attack, where access to a system is gained by trying all the possibilities until breaking though.
In terms of physical, Brute Force can be:
1. Forcible Entry:
   The act of gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically breaking or bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors or fences.
2. Tampering with Security Devices:
   Involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited
3. Confronting Security Personnel:
   Involves the direct confrontation or attack of security personnel
4. Ramming a Barrier with a Vehicle:
   Brute force attack that uses a car, truck or other motorized vehicle to ram into the organization's physical security barriers.

```
Brute force attacks on physical security are direct, often violent approach to bypassing security measures.

### Surveillance Systems
Maintain the security and safety of facilities, including business, home, or commonly used public areas.
- Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activates in a given area.
- Traditional security guards and high-tech sensors both aim to monitor for suspicious or harmful activities.

Surveillance often contains four main categories:
1. Video Surveillance:
   This involves the use of cameras to monitor and record activity in and around a premise. Video surveillance helps provide real-time observation and can be used for later investigation or as evidence in case of an incident.
2. Security Guards:
   Security Guards are personnel hired to protect property, people, and assets. They play a crucial role in maintaining security by providing physical presence, monitoring surveillance systems, and responding to incidents.
3. Lighting:
   Proper lighting is crucial for security. Well-lit areas make it harder for intruders to hide and easier for surveillance systems to capture clear footage. Motion-activated lighting can also deter criminal activity by making intruders feel exposed.
4. Sensors:
   These devices detect movement, heat, sound, or other environmental changes and can trigger alarms or notifications. Common types of security sensors include motion detectors, glass break sensors, and infrared sensors, which help monitor for unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
	- Infrared Sensor: 
	  These sensors detect heat signatures from people or objects. They can detect the infrared radiation emitted by living beings, allowing them to spot movement in an area without using visible light. Often used in motion detectors, they are great for identifying intruders in low-light or dark conditions.
	- Pressure Sensor: 
	  These sensors detect physical pressure or changes in weight, such as when someone steps on a surface or applies force. They are commonly used in floor mats or door/window alarms, where any pressure change can trigger an alert. Pressure sensors are often employed in entry points like doors or windows.
	- Microwave Sensor: 
	  Microwave sensors emit microwave pulses and measure the reflection off moving objects. When an object, like a person, moves within the sensor's range, the reflection changes, which triggers an alarm. These sensors can cover larger areas compared to infrared sensors and can detect movement through walls or obstacles.
	- Ultrasonic Sensor: 
	  These sensors use sound waves (at frequencies higher than human hearing) to detect objects. They emit ultrasonic pulses and measure the time it takes for the sound to bounce back from a surface. In security, ultrasonic sensors are typically used to detect motion or changes in space, such as an intruder moving through a monitored area.
### Bypassing Surveillance System
There are several methods for bypassing surveillance systems, including the following techniques:

1. Visual Obstruction : 
   This involves physically blocking or obscuring the view of cameras, using objects like walls, cloths, or even mirrors to prevent cameras from recording specific areas.
2. Blinding Sensors and Cameras: 
   This method targets the sensor or lens of surveillance equipment, often by using bright lights, lasers, or other devices to temporarily impair their functionality and make them unable to capture footage.
3. Acoustic Interface: 
   Using sound-based methods to interfere with or manipulate the surveillance system, such as emitting ultrasonic noise to confuse microphones or sensors.
4. Electromagnetic Interference: 
   Electromagnetic fields can disrupt the operation of electronic surveillance systems, potentially causing cameras and sensors to malfunction or stop transmitting data.
5. Physical Environment Attack: 
   This involves manipulating the physical environment to disable surveillance systems, such as damaging cables, disrupting power sources, or damaging the hardware itself.
### Access Control Vestibules
Double-door system that is designed with two doors that are electronically controlled to ensure that only one door can be opened at a given time.
Also known as a security vestibule or mantrap, is a small, enclosed space located at the entrance of a building. It typically consists of two sets of interlocking doors that create a buffer zone between the outside environment and the secure area of the facility. This design prevents unauthorized access and enhances security by ensuring that only one door can be open at a time.

This Access Control Vestibules helps to prevent Piggybacking and Tailgating:
- Piggybacking: This occurs when an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following an authorized person, usually with their knowledge or consent. For example, if someone uses their badge to swipe into a secure building and another person follows closely behind, hoping that the door will not close before they get in.
- Tailgating: This is similar to piggybacking, but it typically happens without the authorized person's knowledge or consent. In this case, the unauthorized individual intentionally follows closely behind someone who has legitimate access to bypass security. For example, someone might walk into a secure building just after an employee enters without swiping their own badge.
### Door Lock
Physical security control that is designed to secure entryways by restricting and regulating access to a particular space or property.

1. Padlock: 
   A portable, locking mechanism often used to secure gates, doors, or storage units. Padlocks come in various designs, including keyed and combination types. They are usually made of metal and are widely used for general security purposes.

2. Simple Pin and Tumbler Lock: 
   A traditional lock system where the lock mechanism is composed of pins that align with a specific key. When the correct key is inserted, the pins align and the lock can be turned. These are commonly used in door locks and are relatively secure against casual tampering.

3. Numeric Locks: 
   These locks use a numeric keypad, where the user must enter a specific code (usually a combination of numbers) to gain access. These are often seen in places like safes, office doors, or lockers, and they eliminate the need for physical keys.

4. Wireless Locks: 
   These locks use wireless technology like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or RFID to allow access through a mobile app or remote control. Wireless locks provide convenience, as users can unlock doors from a distance or with a smartphone, and some can even track access history.

5. Biometric Locks: 
   Biometric locks use unique physical traits, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to grant access. These systems provide a high level of security since biometric identifiers are unique to each individual, making them harder to duplicate or forge.
	- False Acceptance Rate (FAR) measures the probability that a biometric system incorrectly accepts an unauthorized person, while False Reject Rate (FRR) measures the likelihood that the system wrongly rejects a valid user. Equal Error Rate (EER) is the point where FAR and FRR are equal, indicating the balance between security (low FAR) and user convenience (low FRR). A lower EER indicates a better-performing biometric system, as it minimizes both false acceptances and false rejections, providing a more reliable and user-friendly experience.

6. Cipher Lock: 
   A type of combination lock that requires the user to enter a specific code (usually on a keypad) to unlock it. Cipher locks are often used for secure areas that need limited, controlled access. 

7. Electronic Access Control System: This is a more sophisticated access control system that integrates various types of electronic locks (including RFID, biometric, key card systems). These systems are often used in high-security areas and can include features like access logs, remote management, and integration with security systems like alarms or surveillance cameras.
### Access Badge Cloning
Radio Frequency Identification (RFI) and Near Field Communication (NFC) are popular technologies used for contactless authentication in various application, but there is prevalent vulnerability with this technology to bypass your authentication: Access Badge Cloning

Access Badge Cloning: Refers to copying the data from the RFID or NFC or badge onto another card or device.
Steps:
1. Scanning
2. Data exfiltration
3. Writing to a new card
4. Using a cloned access badge

Explanations:
1. Scanning:
   An attacker can use a handheld RFID or NFC reader to capture data from a victim's card and store it for further processing.
2. Data Exfiltration:
   Once the data is captured, attackers extract the relevant authentication credentials from the card.
3. Writing to a new card:
   Using specialized writing tools, the attackers will then transfer the extracted data into a black RFID or NFC card.
4. Using a cloned access badge:
   Now that the attacker has their cloned access badge or device in hand, they can gain unauthorized access to building, computer systems, or even make payments.

How to mitigate this vulnerability:
1. Implement advanced encryption in card-based authentication systems
2. Implement multifactor authentication
3. Regularly update the security protocol
4. Educate the users
5. Users should implement the use of shielded wallets or sleeves with RFID access badges
6. Monitor and audit the access logs

Flipper Zero is a portable multi-functional hacking device designed for interaction with various access control systems, including RFID and NFC.
