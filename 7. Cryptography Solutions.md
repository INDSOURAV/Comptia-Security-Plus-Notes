- Practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the information.
- Now, most commonly, we are going to use cryptography as a form of "Encryption".
### Encryption
Process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into unintelligible form (ciphertext).
Encryption is used to provide protection to us with "Data at Rest", "Data in Transit" and "Data in Use".
- A "Cipher" is an algorithm or mathematical concept that perform the encryption or decryption of the data.
- Encryption strength comes from the "Key", not from "Algorithm".
- Key is an essential piece of information that determine the output of a cipher.

There are two primary types of encryption techniques (based on how many keys are used for encryption & decryption):
1. Symmetric Encryption
2. Asymmetric Encryption

Explanations:
1. Symmetric Encryption:
   An encryption algorithm in which both the sender and the receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key.
   Advantages: 
    - Fast and efficient for encrypting large volumes of data.
   Limitations: 
	- Secure key exchange is difficult 
	- In large environments, if one user needs to communicate securely with multiple users, a separate unique key is required for each communication pair, which significantly increases the number of keys and makes key management complex.
   
2. Asymmetric Encryption:
   An encryption algorithm where different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
   Advantages: 
    - Provides secure key exchange and supports digital signatures.
   Limitations: 
    - Slower than symmetric encryption and less efficient for large data volumes.

```
Hybrid Encryption Implementation:
A hybrid encryption model uses asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric session key, which is then used with symmetric encryption to encrypt the actual data.
```

There are two more type of Encryption based on how data Is processed:
1. Stream Cipher
2. Block Cipher

Explanations:
1. Stream Cipher:
   A stream cipher encrypts data one bit or byte at a time by generating a continuous keystream that is combined with plaintext by an XOR function.
   `Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Keystream`
   Stream Cipher is very fast with low latency and well suited for real-time communications but reuse of the keystream can compromise security

2. Block Cipher:
   A block cipher encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (for example, 64, 128 or 256 bits at a time).
   Block Cipher is widely used for data at rest and bulk data encryption, but padding may be required.
### Symmetric Algorithms
1. DES and 3DES
2. IDEA
3. AES
4. Blowfish
5. Twofish
6. Rivest Ciphers (RC4, RC5, RC6) 

Explanations:
1. DES and 3DES (Data Encryption Standard):
   DES: Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64-bit blocks and uses 16 rounds of transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56-bits.
   3DES: Encryption algorithm which uses three separate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt (scramble), then encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext in order to increase the strength of DES with key size of 122-bits.

2. IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm):
   IDEA is a symmetric block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 128-bit key. It is well known for its use in the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) suite of cryptographic tools, where it was widely adopted for secure email encryption.

3. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
   AES is a symmetric block cipher, also known as the Rijndael cipher, that encrypts data in fixed 128-bit blocks using encryption key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits to convert plaintext into ciphertext.

4. Blowfish:
   Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a variable-length key ranging from 32 bits to 448 bits to transform plaintext into ciphertext.

5. Twofish:
   Twofish is a symmetric block cipher that uses a 128-bit block size and supports encryption key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
   Both Blowfish and Twofish were never patented and were released as open-source algorithms, making them freely available for public use.

6. Rivest Ciphers (RC4, RC5, RC6):
   The Rivest Ciphers (RC) were created by Ron Rivest, a cryptographer who designed a series of encryption algorithms collectively known as RC (Rivest Cipher).
    - RC1: Never published
    - RC2: Block cipher; considered weak by modern standards and largely deprecated
    - RC3: Cracked before it was officially released
    - RC4: Stream cipher with key sizes ranging from 40 bits to 2048 bits; historically used in WEP and SSL/TLS, but now insecure and deprecated
    - RC5: Block cipher with variable block size, variable rounds, and key sizes up to 2048 bits
    - RC6: An updated and enhanced version of RC5; was a finalist in the AES competition but not selected
### Asymmetric Algorithms
1. Diffie-Hellman (DH)
2. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Explanations:
1. Diffie-Hellman (DH):
   Diffie–Hellman is a key exchange algorithm used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over an unsecured network. It is commonly used in VPN tunnels and encrypted communication channels to establish a shared secret for symmetric encryption.

2. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA):
   RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It uses key sizes typically ranging from 1024 to 4096 bits, with 2048 bits and above recommended for secure implementations.

3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric cryptographic approach based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It is widely used in mobile and resource-constrained devices due to its high efficiency and strong security with smaller key sizes.
   
   ECC provides equivalent security with much shorter keys compared to RSA, making it significantly faster and more efficient in terms of processing power, memory usage, and bandwidth.
   `ECC (256-bit) = RSA (2048 bit)`
   
   Versions:
    - ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman): ECC version of the popular DH key exchange protocol
    - ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral): Uses a different key for each portion of the key establishment process inside the DH key-exchange
    - ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): Used as a public key encryption algorithm by the US government in their digital signatures.

```
Asymmetric cryptography ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation by using public- and private-key pairs along with digital signatures. The sender encrypts the data using the receiver’s public key, ensuring that only the receiver can decrypt it with their private key, which provides confidentiality. A digital signature is attached by hashing the data and encrypting the hash with the sender’s private key. The receiver verifies this signature using the sender’s public key, confirming integrity (data was not altered) and authentication (the sender’s identity). Since the signature is created using the sender’s private key, the sender cannot deny sending the message, ensuring non-repudiation.

A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital data. It is created by generating a hash of the data and encrypting that hash with the sender’s private key. The receiver uses the sender’s public key to decrypt and verify the hash; if it matches the recalculated hash of the received data, it confirms that the data has not been altered and that it was signed by the legitimate sender.

```
### Hashing
One-way cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a unique message digest as its output.
Hashing Algorithms:
1. MD5
2. SHA Family
3. RIPEMD
4. HMAC

Explanations:
1. MD5:
   MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that generates a 128-bit hash value unique to the input data. However, because the output length is only 128 bits, the number of possible hash values is limited, making MD5 vulnerable to hash collisions, where two different inputs produce the same hash digest. Due to this weakness, MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and is not recommended for security-related use.

2. SHA family:
    - SHA1:
      Creates a 160-bit hash digest, which significantly reduce the number of collisions that occur.
    - SHA2:
      Family of hash functions that contain longer hash digests (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512)
    - SHA3:
      Newer family of hash functions, and its hash digest can go between 224 buts to 512 bits, with major increase of security because of uses 120 rounds of computations instead of 64 to 80 rounds used by SHA2.
      
3. RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest):
   Comes in 160-bit, 256-bit and 320-bit version, it's an open-source hashing algorithm created as a competitor of SHA family.

4. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code):
   Used to check the integrity of a message and provides some level of assurance that its authenticity is real, HMAC paired with other algorithms to do the work as HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256.

One of the most common application of hash is "Digital Signature"
- Digital Security Algorithm (DSA)
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography version of either DSA or SHA

```
Code signing is a security process used to verify that software or scripts come from a trusted publisher and have not been altered since they were signed.

When code is signed, the developer creates a hash of the code and encrypts that hash using their private key, forming a digital signature. When a user or system runs the code, the operating system or application verifies the signature using the publisher’s public key (usually provided via a trusted code-signing certificate). If the hash matches, it confirms the code’s integrity and authenticity.
```
### Increasing Hash Security
#### Hash Attacks:
1. Pass-the-Hash Attack:
   A Pass-the-Hash attack is a technique where an attacker uses a stolen password hash to authenticate to systems without knowing the actual plaintext password. This commonly targets Windows environments using NTLM authentication, allowing attackers to move laterally across systems once a hash is compromised.
   
2. Birthday Attack:
   A **Birthday Attack** is a **cryptographic attack** that exploits the **birthday paradox** to find **hash collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash value. It significantly reduces the effort required to find collisions, especially in **weak or short hash functions** like MD5 or SHA-1.
#### How to Secure Hash:
1. Key Stretching
2. Salting
3. Nonce

Explanations:
1. Key Stretching:
   Key stretching is a technique used to make weak passwords more secure by applying a hash function multiple times (or using computationally expensive algorithms) to increase the time and effort required for brute-force attacks.

2. Salting:
   Salting involves adding a unique random value (salt) to a password before hashing it. This ensures that identical passwords produce different hash values, protecting against rainbow table and precomputed hash attacks.
   Salting prevents rainbow table attacks by ensuring identical passwords produce different hashes.
   
   Rainbow tables are precomputed tables of password hashes used to quickly reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords. They are effective against unsalted hashes but largely ineffective when salting is properly implemented.

3. Nonce:
   A nonce is a number used once in cryptographic operations to ensure freshness and uniqueness of data. It helps prevent replay attacks and is commonly used in encryption protocols, authentication challenges, and digital signatures.
### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a comprehensive system of hardware, software, policies, procedures, and people that is based on asymmetric cryptography. It provides a framework for creating, managing, distributing, storing, and revoking digital certificates and cryptographic keys, enabling secure data transfer, authentication, and encrypted communication across networks.
### Digital Certificate
A digital certificate is an electronic credential that binds a public key to the identity of an individual, organization, or system. It is issued and digitally signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), which verifies the owner’s identity. Digital certificates are used to enable secure communication, authentication, and encryption by allowing others to trust that a public key truly belongs to the claimed entity.

Digital Certificate Entities:
1.  Wildcard Certificate & Subject Alternative Name (SAN):
    Wildcard Certificate: A certificate that secures a domain and all its subdomains (e.g., `.example.com`).
    SAN Certificate: 
    A certificate that can secure multiple different domain names or hostnames within a single certificate.

2. Single-Sided Certificate and Dual-Sided Certificate:
   A certificate where only one party (usually the server) is authenticated, such as in standard HTTPS, where the client verifies the server’s identity.
   
3. Dual-Sided Certificate (mutual TLS):
   A certificate-based authentication method where both client and server authenticate each other using digital certificates, commonly used in enterprise VPNs and secure APIs.

4. Self-Signed Certificate:
   A certificate that is signed by the entity that created it, not by a trusted CA. It provides encryption but does not provide trust, unless manually trusted.

5. Third-Party Certificate:
   A third-party certificate is a digital certificate issued and signed by a trusted external Certificate Authority (CA) that provides public trust and identity validation. The root certificates of these CAs are pre-installed (embedded) in major web browsers and operating systems, allowing certificates they issue to be automatically trusted.

6. Root of Trust:
   The foundational trusted entity in PKI, typically a root CA certificate, from which all trust relationships are derived.

7. Certificate Authority (CA):
   A trusted organization (third party) responsible for issuing, signing, managing, and revoking digital certificates.

8. Registration Authority (RA):
   An entity that verifies the identity of a certificate requester on behalf of the CA before a certificate is issued.

9. Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
   A request generated by an applicant that contains their public key and identifying information, sent to a CA to request a digital certificate.

10. Certificate Revocation List (CRL):
    A list published by a CA containing certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date.

11. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):
    A real-time protocol used to check the revocation status of a digital certificate without downloading a full CRL by using its serial number.

12. OCSP Stapling:
    OCSP Stapling is a technique in which the server provides a cached OCSP response during the TLS handshake. The server regularly fetches and updates this response from the Certificate Authority, allowing clients to verify the certificate’s revocation status without directly contacting the CA, thereby improving performance, reducing latency, and enhancing user privacy.

13. Public Key Pinning:
    A security mechanism that binds a service to a specific public key or CA, preventing attackers from using rogue or compromised certificates, ensures a client accepts only pre-approved public keys for a service, preventing rogue certificate attacks.

14. Key Escrow Agents:
    Trusted entities that securely store encryption keys, allowing access under specific legal or organizational circumstances.

15. Key Recovery Agents:
    Authorized entities or software responsible for recovering encrypted data or keys if the original key is lost or unavailable.
### Blockchain
- A shared immutable ledger for recording transactions, tacking assets, and building trust.
- A blockchain is a really long series of information, with each block containing information.
- Each block contains the hash for the block before it.

Smart Contracts:
Self-executing contracts where the terms of agreements or conditions are written directly into the line of code, the decentralized and transparent nature of the blockchain ensures that once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered, making the agreement tamper-proof and trustworthy.

Permissioned Blockchain: A permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain where access is restricted and participants must be authorized before they can join the network. Unlike public blockchains, not everyone can read, write, or validate transactions. A central authority or consortium controls permissions, identities, and roles.
### Encryption Tools:
1. TPM
2. HSM
3. Key Management System
4. Secure Enclave

Explanations:
1. TPM (Trusted Platform Module):
   A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a dedicated hardware microcontroller designed to provide hardware-level security by securely generating, storing, and protecting cryptographic keys. TPM ensures that sensitive data such as encryption keys, credentials, and certificates remain confidential and unaltered, even if the operating system is compromised.
   It can be thought of as a secure hardware vault that stores and protects digital secrets in encrypted form. BitLocker drive encryption, where the TPM securely stores the disk encryption keys.

2. HSM (Hardware Security Module):
   A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical security device designed to generate, store, protect, and manage cryptographic keys. It is primarily used in mission-critical environments such as financial transactions, payment systems, and certificate authorities.
   In addition to secure key storage, an HSM provides hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations, ensuring high performance, strong security, and protection against tampering and key extraction.

```
TPM →Personal Vault
HSM →High Security Bank Vault
```

3. Key Management System:
   A Key Management System (KMS) is an integrated solution used to generate, store, distribute, rotate, and revoke cryptographic keys for devices, applications, and services. It centralizes key control and enforces security policies, helping ensure keys are managed securely throughout their lifecycle.

4. Secure Enclave:
   A Secure Enclave is a dedicated, isolated coprocessor integrated into the main system-on-chip, designed specifically for protecting sensitive data such as cryptographic keys and biometric information. By keeping this data separate from the main processor, the Secure Enclave ensures that even if the operating system is compromised, the protected data remains secure and inaccessible.
### Obfuscation
1. Steganography
2. Tokenization
3. Data Masking

Explanations:
1. Steganography:
   Derived from Greek words meaning "covered writing", and it is all about concealing a message within another so that the very existence of the message is hidden.
   The primary goal here is not just to prevent unauthorized access to the data, but to prevent the suspicions that there is ant hidden data at all.
   Steganography is frequently used alongside encryption for an extra layer of security.

2. Tokenization:
   Transformative technique in data protection that involves substituting sensitive data elements with non-sensitive equivalents, called token, which have no meaning value.

3. Data Masking:
   Used to protect data by ensuring that it remains recognizable but does not actually include sensitive information.
   Data Masking is also really prevalent in industries that handle vast amounts of personal data.
### Cryptographic Attacks
Techniques and strategies that adversaries employ to exploit vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems with the intent to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity of data.
1. Downgrade Attack
2. Collision Attack
3. Quantum Computing

Explanations:
1. Downgrade Attack:
   A downgrade attack is a technique where an attacker forces a system to use a weaker or outdated cryptographic protocol or algorithm, even though both communicating parties support stronger, more secure options. This typically occurs during the protocol negotiation phase of a secure connection.
   Example:
   In a MITM scenario, the attacker intercepts the initial handshake between a client and a server. During this exchange, the attacker blocks or modifies messages that advertise support for modern, secure protocols (such as TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3). As a result, both the client and server are tricked into falling back to an older, weaker protocol, making the connection easier to exploit.
   POODLE Attack:
   The POODLE attack is a specific type of downgrade attack that targets SSL 3.0. In this attack, a MITM attacker forces the client and server to downgrade from TLS to SSL 3.0, which has weak padding in CBC mode. The attacker then exploits this weakness to decrypt encrypted data, such as session cookies.

2. Collision Attack:
   Aims to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

3. Quantum Computing:
   Quantum computing poses a potential cryptographic threat because it can solve certain mathematical problems much faster than classical computers, which directly impacts modern cryptographic algorithms.
   
   Post-Quantum Cryptography:
   Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to remain secure against attacks from quantum computers. These algorithms are built on mathematical problems that are not efficiently solvable by known quantum algorithms, unlike RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC.
