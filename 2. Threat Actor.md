An individual or entity responsible for incident that impact security and data protection.

Understanding threat actors and their motivation is a crucial part of developing effective cyber-security strategies.
### Threat Actor Motivation:
1. Data Exfiltration
2. Financial Gain
3. Blackmail
4. Service Disruption
5. Philosophical or Political Beliefs
6. Ethical Reasons
7. Revenge
8. Disruption and Chaos
9. Espionage
10. War

Explanations:
1. Data Exfiltration:
   The unauthorized transfer of data from a computer
	- selling it on dark web
	- using it for identity theft
	- leveraging it for a competitive advantage
2. Financial Gain:
   One of the most common motivation for cyber-criminals
	- ransomware attack
	- banking Trojan
3. Blackmail:
   The attacker obtains sensitive or compromising information about an individual or an organization and threatens to release this information to the public unless certain demands are met.
4. Service Disruption:
   Often achieved by conducting a DDoS attack to overwhelm a network, service or server with excessive amount of traffic so that it become unavailable to its normal users.
5. Philosophical or Political Beliefs:
   an Individual or group use hacking to promote a political agenda, social change, or to protest against organizations they perceive an unethical.
	- site defacement
	- data leaks
6. Ethical Reasons:
   Ethical hackers, also known as authorized hackers, are motivated by a desire to improve security.
	- bounty hunters
	- pen testers
7. Revenge:
   An employee who is disgruntled, or one who has recently been fired or laid off, might want to harm their current or former employer by causing a data breach, disrupting services, or leaking sensitive data.
8. Disruption and Chaos:
   These actors, often referred to as unauthorized hackers, engage in malicious activities for the thrill of or to challenge their skills, or simply to cause harm.
9. Espionage:
   Involves spying on individual, organizations, or nation to gather sensitive or classified information.
10. War:
    Cyber-attack have increasingly become a tool for nations to attack each other, both on and off the battlefield.
### Threat Actor Attributes
Analyzing these attributes helps cybersecurity professional understand the nature of the threat and tailor their defense strategies effectively:
1. Internal Vs. External
2. Resources and Funding
3. Level of Sophistication and Capability

Explanations:
1. Internal Vs. External:
	- Internal Threat Actor: an individual or entity within an organization who pose a threat to its security.
	- External Threat Actor: an individual or group outside an organization who attempts to breach its cybersecurity defense, such as: cyber-criminal, hacktivists and state-sponsored actor etc.
2. Resources and Funding:
   Refers to the tools, skills and personnel at the disposal of a given threat actor.
3. Level of Sophistication and Capability:
   Refers to their technical skills, the complexity of the tool and technique they use, and their ability to evade detection and counter-measures.

```
low level of sophistication -> use widely available tools and techniques

high level of sophistication -> use technical skills and sophisticated tools
```
### Unskilled Attackers (Script-Kiddie)
- An individual who lacks the technical knowledge to develop their own hacking tools or exploits.
- Unskilled Attackers can still cause significant damage using readily available tool and exploits to victimize a system with unpatched, known vulnerabilities.
Example:
many script kiddies have used ready to use tools to launch a DDoS attack against an organization. (LOIC/Low Orbit Ion Cannon: LOIC is a software that can perform DDoS attacks on web servers)
- Many unskilled attackers are motivated by a desire for recognition or the thrill of causing disruption to an organization's network.
### Hacktivist
- An individual or group that use their technical skills to promote a cause or drive social change instead of for personal gain.
- Use cyberattack to achieve their ideological or political beliefs, by:
	- website defacement
	- DDoS attack
	- doxing
	- leaking of sensitive data
- Hacktivist demonstrate a fairly high level of sophistication.
Example:
- operation pay-back campaign by Anonymous (2010): It targeted organizations and websites associated with anti-piracy efforts, such as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in response to their crackdown on online piracy. The campaign involved Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
### Organized Crime
Sophisticated and well-structured entities that leverage resources and technical skills for illicit gain, by:
- data breaches
- identity theft
- online fraud
- ransomware attack
Example:
FIN-7, also known as "Carbanak Group" or "Navigator Group," is a highly sophisticated and notorious cybercrime group. They are primarily known for targeting financial institutions, stealing sensitive data, and deploying ransomware. Their operations are often financially motivated, and they use advanced techniques like phishing and malware to infiltrate systems.
### Nation-State Actor:
- Group that are sponsored by a government to conduct cyber operations against other nations, organizations, or individual.
- This threat actor, also perform False Flag Attack: an attack that is orchestrated in such a way that it appears to originate from a different source or group.
  Example: 
  **Olympic Destroyer (2018)** was a malware attack that disrupted IT systems at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in **South Korea**, disabling networks, Wi-Fi, and broadcasts.  It is known as a **false flag attack**, using misleading evidence to implicate multiple actors, though it is **widely attributed to Russia (GRU)**.
- Nation-State Actor are capable to conduct complex, coordinated cyber operation that employs a variety of techniques:
	- creating custom malware
	- using zero-day exploits
- APT (Advanced Persistent Threat): Term that used to be used synonymously with a nation-state actor because of their long-term persistence and stealth.
- Their motivations:
	- gathering intelligence
	- disrupting critical infrastructure
	- influencing political processes
Example:
**Stuxnet (discovered in 2010)** was a highly advanced cyberweapon that targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, It is widely attributed to a joint operation by the **United States and Israel**, marking the first known malware to cause physical damage to industrial systems.
### Insider Threats
- Cybersecurity threats that originate from within the organization.
- Motivation:
	- driven by financial gain, and they want to profit from the sale of sensitive organizational data to others.
	- motivated by revenge and are aiming to harm to organization, sue to some kind of perceived wrong levied against the insider.
	- result of carelessness or a lack of awareness of cybersecurity best practices by one of the organization's users.
### Shadow IT
- The use of information technology systems, devices, software, applications and services without explicit organizational approval.
- Also, known as Stealth IT or Client IT.
Example:
- use of personal devices for work purposes
- installation of unapproved software
- use of cloud services that have not been approved by the organization
### Threat Vector and Attack Surface
Attack Surface:
Attack Surface is the total collection of all potential entity point (asset vulnerability), an attacker can target.
Example:
- user account
- cloud services
- physical device
- web application

```
Attack surface can be minimized by restricting access, removing unnecessary software and disabling unused protocol
```

Threat Vector:
The mean or pathway by which an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a computer or network to deliver a malicious payload or carry out an unwanted action.
Example:
- phishing
- malware
- social engineering
  
```
- Evil Twin Attack: A rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network to trick users into connecting, allowing attackers to steal credentials and data.
    
- BlueSmack: A Bluetooth-based denial-of-service attack that floods a device with large ping packets, causing it to freeze or crash.
    
- BlueBorne: A set of Bluetooth vulnerabilities enabling attackers to take control of devices without user interaction, potentially leading to data theft and malware spread.
```
### Out-Smarting Threat Actor
One of the most effective ways to learn from the different threat actors that are attacking your network is to set up and utilize deception and disruption technologies.
Deception technologies used to detect, lure, and study attackers:
1. Honeypot
2. Honeynet
3. Honeyfile
4. Honeytoken

Explanations:
1. Honeypot:
   Decoy system or network set up to attract potential hackers, the primary focus of a honeypot is not to block or prevent attacks but is instead focused on gathering information about the attacker's method, motive and TTPs.
   
2. Honeynet:
   Network of honeypot to create a more complex system that is designed to mimic an entire network of system, including server, routers and switches.
   
   Honeypot and Honeynet both have risks that the attacker cloud use to learn how production systems are configured.
   
3. Honeyfile:
   Decoy file placed within a system to lure potential attackers, this file can be:
	
4. Honeytoken:
   Piece of data or a resource that has no legitimate value or use but is monitoring for access or use, such as:
	- fake user account
	- bogus URL
	- dummy database record
	useful for detecting insider threats and if the Honeytoken is accessed or used, this is a clear indication of data breach

**Disruption technologies** are tools, methods, or techniques designed to interfere with, confuse, or obstruct normal operations, systems, or processes.
1. Bogus DNS
2. Decoy Directory
3. Dynamic Page Generation
4. Port Forwarding
5. Fake Telemetry Data

Explanations:
1. Bogus DNS:
   Fake DNS entries introduced into a system's DNS server, to mislead attackers into accessing a non-existing domain or trap a system to waste the attacker's time.
   
2. Decoy Directory:
   Fake folders and files placed within a system's storage to mislead an attacker.

3. Dynamic Page Generation:
   Used in websites to prevent ever-changing content to web crawlers to confuse and slow down the threat actor. Best against the automated scrubbing tool and bots trying to index or steal content from your organization's website.

4. Port Forwarding
   Security mechanism where specific service or ports on a network device remain closed until a specific outbound traffic pattern is detected.
   
5. Fake Telemetry Data
   System can respond to an attacker's network scan attempt by sending out fake telemetry or network data.
