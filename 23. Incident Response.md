The incident response process is a critical component of cybersecurity that outline a systematic approach that an organization should take to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively.
The primary goal of incident response is to minimize the impact of security breaches, reduce the time it takes to identify and contain threats, and facilitate a swift recovery to normal operations.
This process typically involves several key steps:
1. Incident Detection and Classification
2. Threat Containment and Eradication
3. Evidence Preservation
4. Communication and Reporting
5. Lesson Learned
### Incident Response Process
Incident: Act of violating an explicit or implied security policy.
Incident Response Procedure: Guidelines for handling security incidents.

1. Preparation
2. Detection
3. Analysis
4. Containment
5. Eradication
6. Recovery
7. Post-incident activity/Lesson learned

Explanations:
1. Preparation:
   This phase focuses on getting everything ready before an incident happens. It includes creating policies, setting up monitoring tools, training the team, defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring systems are hardened. The goal is to build a strong foundation, so the organization can respond quickly and effectively when an incident occurs.
2. Detection:
   In this stage, the security team identifies potential threats or unusual activities. Alerts from security tools like SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, firewall logs, and user reports help in spotting suspicious behavior. The aim is to catch incidents as early as possible to reduce impact.
3. Analysis:
   After detecting something suspicious, the team investigates it to understand what’s actually happening. This involves checking logs, network traffic, endpoint data, malware samples, or user activity to confirm whether it’s a real incident, what systems are affected, how severe it is, and how the attacker got in.
4. Containment:
   Once an incident is confirmed, the goal is to stop the attacker from causing further damage. This can include isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IPs, resetting credentials, or disabling compromised accounts. Containment protects the rest of the environment while the issue is being resolved.
5. Eradication:
   After containing the threat, the team removes the root cause from the environment. This may involve deleting malware, closing vulnerabilities, removing unauthorized access, applying patches, or cleaning up malicious files. The aim is to ensure the threat cannot return.
6. Recovery:
   Now the systems are restored back to normal operations. This includes rebuilding systems, restoring backups, reconfiguring devices, and monitoring them closely to ensure no remnants of the attack remain. The focus is on safely bringing business operations back online.
7. Post-incident Activity / Lessons Learned:
   After the incident is fully resolved, the team reviews what happened, how it was handled, and what can be improved. This may involve updating policies, improving detection rules, fixing process gaps, enhancing training, and documenting the incident for future reference. The goal is continuous improvement, so the organization becomes stronger against future attacks.

After-action Report: Collects formalized information about what occurred.
### Threat Hunting
Threat hunting is a cybersecurity technique that is designed to detect the presence of threats that have not been discovered by normal security of monitoring.

Normal monitoring is reactive and relies on predefined rules, signatures, and alerts to detect known threats, while threat hunting is proactive and starts with the assumption that existing detection mechanisms may have missed something, leading analysts to manually search for hidden, unknown, or stealthy threats that do not trigger any current alerts.
- Seek undetected issues
- Focus on what bypasses existing rules
- Explore cases where queries do not yield expected data

The goal in threat hunting is to uncover and detect new threat tactics and IoCs.

Threat hunters use the following sources because they provide up-to-date insights on emerging threats, attacker behaviors, and evolving techniques that help identify risks which may evade existing detection mechanisms:
- Advisories and Bulletins:
  Published by vendors and security researchers when new TTPs and vulnerabilities are discovered.
- Intelligence Fusion and Threat Data:
  Use SIEM and analysis platforms to spot concerns in the logs and real-world security threats.

Threat hunting improves detection by revealing attack methods, which allows for updated rules for more accurate future detection and prevention.
### Root Cause Analysis
A root cause analysis is a systematic process to identify the initial source of the incident and to prevent it from occurring again.

Process of root cause analysis:
1. Define the scope of the incident:
   This step involves clearly understanding what happened, when it happened, and which systems, users, or processes were affected.
   Example: A company notices several failed login attempts followed by one successful login from an unusual location. The scope identifies the affected user account, the timeframe, and the system (e.g., VPN portal).
   
2. Determine the causal relationships:
   Here, we trace the chain of events to understand how and why the incident occurred. We look at contributing factors, vulnerabilities, and sequence of actions.
   Example: Investigation shows the user had reused a weak password, attackers obtained it from a leaked database, and MFA wasn’t enabled—revealing how the attacker succeeded.
   
3. Identify an effective solution:
   Based on the root cause, choose a fix that not only resolves the incident but prevents it from happening again.
   Example: The solution could be enforcing strong password policies, enabling MFA, and educating users about password hygiene.
   
4. Implement and tack the solution:
   Put the solution into action and monitor its effectiveness to ensure the problem is fully resolved and doesn’t recur.
   Example: Enable MFA for all remote logins, push mandatory password resets, and verify through logs and periodic checks that no unauthorized access attempts to succeed.

The primary purpose is not to assign blame but to instead figure out exactly what has occurred to cause the incident.
### Incident Response Training And Testing
Training ensures that staff fully understand incident response processes, roles, and priorities, with tailored sessions designed to meet the needs of different teams across the organization. It also incorporates lessons learned from past incidents to continually strengthen preparedness. Testing, on the other hand, involves practical exercises such as tabletop scenarios, penetration tests, and full-scale simulations to validate the effectiveness of the incident response procedures and identify gaps before a real incident occurs.
### Digital Forensic Procedures
Process of investigating and analyzing digital devices and data to uncover evidence for legal purposes.
Process:
1. Identification:
   This is the stage where investigators determine that an incident has occurred and identify what digital evidence might exist. It involves locating relevant devices, logs, network data, or files that could contain evidence.
   Example: Detecting unusual login activity on a server and identifying that system logs, memory data, and user accounts are key evidence sources.
   
2. Collection:
   Collection involves gathering digital evidence in a forensically sound manner without altering its original state. Proper methods ensure the evidence remains admissible in court.
   Example: Using a write-blocker to copy data from a suspect's hard drive.
   - Order of Volatility:
     This defines the priority for collecting evidence based on how quickly it can be lost. More volatile data (like RAM) should be collected before less volatile data (like disk content).
     Example: Capturing memory first, then network connections, and finally disk data.
   - Chain of Custody:
     A documented record that tracks who collected, handled, transferred, or stored the evidence. It ensures that the evidence was not tampered with and remains legally valid.
     Example: Filling out forms that include timestamps, handlers’ names, and the purpose of each transfer.
   - NIST 800-86:
     A widely accepted guide for digital forensic processes that outlines best practices for evidence handling, analysis, and reporting.  
      - Collect data from the system's memory
      - Capture data from the system state
      - Collect data from storage devices
      - Capture network traffic and logs
      - Collect remotely stored or archived data
   - Disk Imaging:
     Creating a bit-by-bit copy of a storage device to analyze without touching the original evidence.
     Example: Making a forensic image of a suspect’s laptop to analyze deleted files or hidden data.
   - File Carving:
     Recovering files or fragments of files without relying on file system metadata. Useful for retrieving deleted or partially overwritten data.
     Example: Recovering fragments of an erased PDF from raw disk sectors.
   
3. Analysis:
   In this phase, investigators examine the collected data to reconstruct events, identify malicious activity, timelines, and evidence of wrongdoing.
   Example: Analyzing logs, emails, disk images, and network data to find how an attacker gained access.
   
4. Reporting:
   Reporting summarizes findings, evidence recovered, methods used, and the conclusion of the investigation. Reports are clear, legally defensible, and understandable to non-technical stakeholders.
   Example: Documenting the attack timeline, compromised accounts, and root cause in a professional forensic report.
   - Legal Hold:
     A process where an organization preserves all relevant data because it may be needed for legal or investigative purposes.
     Example: A company freezes email deletion for certain employees after detecting fraud.
   - Electronic Discovery (E-Discovery):
     The legal process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) for court or investigation.
     Example: Providing emails, chat logs, and documents as part of litigation after legal approval.
### Data Collection Procedures
Data acquisition focuses on using proper forensic methods and tools to create an exact, legally defensible copy of data from a source device such as system memory, hard disks, or external storage. However, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies often complicate this process because investigators may not have the legal authority to search or seize personally owned devices, even if they contain relevant evidence.

Priority of data collection follows the order of volatility, meaning the most volatile data is collected first before it disappears. This starts with CPU registers and cache memory, followed by system memory (RAM), routing tables, ARP caches, process tables, and temporary swap files, which can quickly change or vanish upon reboot. Next comes data stored on persistent mass storage, such as hard drives and SSDs, which remain intact after power loss. After that, investigators collect remotely logged and monitored data, including SIEM logs, network device logs, and cloud logs. Finally, less volatile information like physical configuration and network topology, as well as long-term archival media, is gathered since this data is the least likely to change.
Additionally, certain Windows registry keys, such as HKLM\Hardware, reside only in memory and require a full memory dump to be preserved for forensic analysis.
